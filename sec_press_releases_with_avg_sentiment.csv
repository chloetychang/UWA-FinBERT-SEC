0,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged nine transfer agents for failing to report on their Year 2000 preparedness as required. Five of the firms settled the charges and four are contesting them. The Commission's rules required firms to file Form TA-Y2K with the Commission by August 31, 1998, but these nine transfer agents failed to file all or part of this Form by December 8, 1998. Three of the nine transfer agents agreed to cease and desist from further violations, be censured, and pay a $7,500 civil penalty. They are: CSJ, LLC, Houston, TX; Davidson Trust Co., Great Falls, MT; and Ivy MacKenzie Services Corp., Boca Raton, FL. Two transfer agents agreed to cease and desist from further violations, be censured, but not pay a civil monetary penalty based on inability to pay. The two are Corporate Planners, Inc., Fountain Hills, AZ and National Stock Transfer and Accounting, Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, FL. The remaining four transfer agents are contesting the charges. They are: Alpha Tech Stock Transfer Trust, Draper, UT; Greenfield Fund Inc., Old Greenwich, CT; Manor Investment Funds, Inc., West Chester, PA; and United Stock Transfer, Inc., Englewood, CO. SEC Commissioner Laura S. Unger, who is spearheading the Commission's Year 2000 efforts, said, ""As the new millennium approaches, these cases amplify our message that we will not tolerate anything less than full disclosure from the securities industry as to its Year 2000 readiness. Investors and other market participants have the right to know if those they do business with have any Y2K-related computer problems and, if so, whether those problems are being ironed out."" Failure of transfer agents to anticipate and cure Year 2000 problems could seriously disrupt corporate communications with shareholders affecting payment of dividends, exercise of options, and notification of important corporate developments, including those requiring shareholder action. Transfer agents must disclose on Form TA-Y2K the steps they have taken to address Year 2000 problems, including contingency plans in case they are not ready in time. The Commission will use Form TA-Y2K to obtain a more complete picture of the securities industry's overall Year 2000 preparations and to identify firm-specific and industry-wide problems. --more-- Transfer Agent News Release January 7, 1999 Page 2 Transfer agents must file an updated Form TA-Y2K by April 30, 1999.

1,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued Livent, Inc. and nine former senior officers, directors, and members of the accounting staff of Livent, Inc. for engaging in a multi-faceted and pervasive accounting fraud spanning eight years from 1990 through the first quarter of 1998. Five individuals are also alleged to have engaged in insider trading. Also today, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of former Livent officials Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb for sixteen felony counts each, for violations of the federal securities laws. In addition, the U.S. Attorney announced that former Livent officials Gordon C. Eckstein and Maria Messina pled guilty to one felony count each, for violations of the federal securities laws. Richard H. Walker, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Accounting fraud strikes at the heart of the integrity of the securities markets and will not be tolerated by the Commission. This case should send a strong message to officials of public companies that the Commission is on guard for companies that cook the books and when detected we will take swift action."" The SEC charges, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, allege that Garth Drabinsky, Livent's former chairman and chief executive officer, and Myron Gottlieb, the company's former president and a director, were the architects of an accounting fraud designed to inflate earnings, revenues, and assets reported by the company in financial statements filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public. As a result of the fraud, Livent made at least seventeen false filings with the Commission that materially overstated the results of Livent's operations and its financial condition. According to the SEC, Drabinsky and Gottlieb manipulated income and operating cash flows with the active participation of several long-time associates, including Gordon Eckstein, Livent's former senior vice president of finance and administration, Robert Topol, the company's former senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, as well as several individuals in the company's accounting department. Maria Messina, Livent's former chief financial officer and former Deloitte & Touche engagement partner for Livent's 1995 audit, also participated in the scheme. Drabinsky and Gottlieb also enlisted the support and assistance of numerous Livent personnel in their far-reaching fraud and solicited assistance from various other individuals and entities to facilitate and conceal the fraud. Also, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the fraudulent conduct at Livent, the SEC alleges, Eckstein, Topol, Tony Fiorino, Livent's former theater controller, D. Grant Malcolm, Livent's former senior production controller, and Diane Winkfein, Livent's former senior corporate controller, engaged in insider trading of Livent securities. Penalties Sought: The Commission seeks to permanently restrain and enjoin Drabinsky, Gottlieb, Topol, Eckstein, Messina, Winkfein, Malcolm and Fiorino from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks civil monetary penalties against them. The SEC further seeks to permanently bar Drabinsky, Gottlieb, Topol and Eckstein from serving as officers or directors of a public company. Finally, the SEC seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest and Insider Trading Sanctions Act (""ITSA"") penalties from Topol, Eckstein, Fiorino, Malcolm, and Winkfein for insider trading. Settled Federal Court Actions: Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint the following settlements were agreed to: Gordon C. Eckstein: Agreed to not violate the federal securities laws and to be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company. He did not admit or deny the allegations. Diane J. Winkfein and D. Grant Malcolm: Agreed to not violate the federal securities laws. They did not admit or deny the allegations. Winkfein also agreed to pay $8,137 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Settled Administrative Orders: Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint the following settlements were agreed to: Livent, Inc.: Agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of various provisions of the federal securities laws and to cooperate with the Commission's ongoing investigation. Livent did not admit or deny the findings. Gordon C.

2,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Donnkenny, Inc. - a manufacturer and marketer of women's sportswear and other apparel - and four former senior executives and employees with perpetrating a financial fraud from early 1994 until the Fall of 1996. The individuals were also charged with illegal insider trading. Also today, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York announced that Donnkenny's former chairman and chief executive officer, Richard F. Rubin, today pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, a felony. The U.S. Attorney also announced that Donnkenny's former top-two financial officers - Edward T. Creevy and Ronald H. Hollandsworth - each have similarly pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Richard H. Walker, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The integrity of our markets rests upon the accuracy of financial reporting. Ensuring accurate financial reporting by holding individuals responsible for outright fraud and unacceptable earnings management is a top priority of the Commission. Today's cases demonstrate the resolve of both the Commission and the criminal authorities to stamp out financial fraud and protect investors."" The SEC charges, filed in District Court for the District of Columbia, allege that: Richard Rubin fraudulently managed the company's reported revenues and earnings beginning in at least early 1994 and continuing until at least August 1996. Rubin directed a scheme whereby the company improperly reported revenue both on sales before they occurred as well as on bogus transactions. His purpose was to create the illusion that each quarter the company's financial results met or exceeded projections and analysts' expectations. As a result of the scheme, Donnkenny publicly disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements and other disclosures through press releases and filings with the SEC. Assisting Rubin were three company employees: Donnkenny's former chief financial officer, Edward Creevy, its former controller, Ronald Hollandsworth, and former assistant controller, Kymberlee W. Kulis. Together these four individuals caused Donnkenny to improperly recognize revenue by: * holding open quarters to book out-of-period shipments; * anticipating future sales by pulling forward orders without shipping the goods to customers; * recording fictitious sales from non-existent contract work and through false journal entries; and * hiding inventory at an idle Donnkenny facility and a third-party warehouse. The SEC further charges that Rubin, Creevy, Hollandsworth, and Kulis each engaged in illegal insider trading by selling Donnkenny securities knowing that the company's publicly reported financial results were materially misstated. The individuals' alleged illegal securities transactions included: * Rubin sold 780,000 shares and caused his wife to sell 77,000 shares of Donnkenny stock, from which the Rubins received proceeds of approximately $17.9 million. In addition, in July 1996, immediately before the fraud was detected, Rubin entered into an options transaction known as a ""no-cost collar"" from which he received approximately $3.6 million after the fraud was revealed and the price of Donnkenny's stock plummeted; * Creevy and Hollandsworth each sold 14,000 shares of Donnkenny stock, receiving profits of $148,325 and $139,250, respectively; and * Kulis sold 899 shares of Donnkenny stock receiving profits and avoiding losses of $10,599. Relief Sought: The Commission seeks to permanently enjoin Rubin, Creevy, Hollandsworth, and Kulis from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission also asked the court to permanently bar Rubin, Creevy, and Hollandsworth from serving as officers or directors of public companies. Finally, in addition to seeking civil money penalties for insider trading and for their respective roles in the financial fraud, the Commission also requested that the court order the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains from their insider trading, and with respect to Rubin, that he disgorge the bonuses he received from the company while directing the fraud. Settlements: Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint the following settlements were agreed to: Kymberlee W. Kulis: Without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, Kulis agreed not to violate the federal securities laws in the future and agreed to pay more than $34,000, representing disgorgement of her trading profits and losses avoided and civil money penalties. Donnkenny, Inc.: Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Donnkenny consented to a Commission order directing the company to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws.

3,"For Immediate Release 99-70 SEC Charges 11 Individuals With Insider Trading U.S. Attorney Also Indicts Former Director of Koo Koo Roo, Inc. Los Angeles, CA, June 23, 1999 -- The Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney for the Central District of California announced today the filing of four civil actions against 11 defendants, including one attorney, and one criminal action, for illegal insider trading. The defendants traded in the securities of three California companies, Trimedyne, Inc., Koo Koo Roo, Inc. and Bio-Dental Technologies Corp., and realized profits in excess of $300,000. Valerie Caproni, the Regional Director for the Commission's Pacific Regional Office, stated, ""These actions underscore the Commission's continued commitment to prosecuting parties who unlawfully trade on inside information. We intend to continue to work closely with the criminal authorities in cases such as these where professionals and members of corporate boards of directors abuse their positions to obtain an unfair advantage in the market. Those who would engage in such conduct are put on notice that they will be subject to both civil sanctions and criminal prosecution when circumstances warrant."" Alejandro Mayorkas, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, stated, ""We are placing increased emphasis on the prosecution of insider trading cases in order to ensure that the public is able to conduct business in a securities market that is fair and equally accessible to all. Our increased efforts come at an opportune time, when the Commission's office here is led by newly appointed Regional Director Valerie Caproni, an individual with tremendous criminal prosecution experience who shares our vision and our goal to put an end to abuses in the securities market."" In the first action, the Commission has charged Raymond Kolts, a Glendale, California attorney, for insider trading in the securities of Trimedyne, Inc., an Irvine, California company that manufactures medical devices. According to the Commission's complaint, Kolts, while representing Trimedyne in a civil lawsuit, learned that the FDA had given approval to Trimedyne to market its medical laser for treatment of enlarged prostate. Kolts also learned at that time that Trimedyne planned to announce publicly the FDA clearance the following week. Before Trimedyne publicly announced this approval, Kolts purchased 2,500 Trimedyne shares, realizing $30,000 in insider trading profits. Kolts is charged with securities fraud and the Commission is seeking an injunction against violations, disgorgement of the insider trading profits, and civil penalties of up to three times the trading profit. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Raymond G. Kolts, No. CV 99-06353 ER (RZx) (C.D. Cal.). In a related action, the Commission sued three other defendants for insider trading in Trimedyne stock. The Commission alleges that Michelle Nguyen, Trimedyne's controller, used inside information to purchase 4,100 Trimedyne shares before the public announcement of the FDA approval, realizing insider trading profits of $42,000. The Commission further alleges that Nguyen tipped her sister, Lisa Nguyen, and brother, Hao Vu, who used the inside information to purchase 8,966 Trimedyne shares, realizing $41,000 in insider trading profits. The Commission has charged the defendants with securities fraud and is seeking an injunction against future violations, disgorgement of the insider trading profits, and civil penalties of up to three times their trading profit. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Michelle Nguyen, Lisa Nguyen, and Hao Vu, No. SACV 99-830 AHS (ANx) (C.D. Cal.). The next actions focus on insider trading by a director of Koo Koo Roo, Inc., a restaurant chain based in Southern California. According to the indictment and the Commission's complaint, in March 1998, Donald Wohl, then a Koo Koo Roo director, learned that the company planned to appoint Lee Iacocca as acting chairman of the board. Wohl used that nonpublic information to purchase 50,000 Koo Koo Roo shares for the accounts of three family members and two business associates, ultimately realizing $65,000 in insider trading profits. Wohl faces up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of $1,000,000 if convicted on the criminal charges. Wohl settled the Commission's action by agreeing to be enjoined from engaging in future fraud violations and from providing investment advice in violation of a previous Commission order barring him from the securities industry. He will be ordered to pay a total of $133,000 in disgorgement of trading profits, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in connection with that settlement. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Donald B. Wohl, No. CV 99-06354 DDP (SHx) (C.D. Cal.); United States of America v. Donald B. Wohl, No. _______ (C.D. Cal.). Finally, the Commission has sued six defendants for unlawfully trading in the stock of Bio-Dental Technologies Corp. before the public announcement that it would be acquired by Zila, Inc. Bio-Dental was a Northern California corporation that manufactured professional dental supplies. The Commission alleges that Rocco Anselmo, a Zila executive, used his advance knowledge of the acquisition in purchasing 10,000 Bio-Dental shares, realizing $23,000 in profits. Anselmo also tipped three friends to the pending merger, James Rammelt, Ivan Kron, and Donald Italia, who purchased a total of 31,200 Bio-Dental shares, realizing $67,000 in insider trading profits. The Commission also sued two Zila consultants, William Sklar and John Manion, who obtained advance knowledge of the acquisition through their work for Zila. According to the complaint, Sklar and Manion used their inside information to purchase Bio-Dental stock in advance of the public announcement. Sklar purchased 9,000 Bio-Dental shares and realized profits of $20,000. Manion purchased 13,000 shares and realized $28,000 in profits. Anselmo, Rammelt, Kron, Italia, and Sklar have settled with the Commission by agreeing to be enjoined from engaging in future securities fraud and to pay a total of $250,000 in disgorgement of trading profits, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The Commission is seeking against Manion an injunction against future violations, disgorgement of the insider trading profits, and civil penalties of up to three times his trading profit. Securities and Exchange Commission v. John R. Manion, Rocco J. Anselmo, James Rammelt, Ivan Kron, Donald S. Italia, and William E. Sklar, No. CIV 99-1103 PHX (ROS) (D. Ariz.).

4,"The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted administrative and cease-and- desist proceedings against A.S. Goldmen & Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer, charging the firm with selling unregistered securities, fraudulent sales practices, and violations of the anti-manipulation provisions. Also charged in the proceedings are: * Anthony J. Marchiano, of Naples, Florida, Goldmen's president and sole owner; * Stuart E. Winkler, of Morganville, N.J., Goldmen's financial and operations principal; * John T. Diasabeyagunawardena (a.k.a. John Abbey) of Metuchen, N.J.; * John P. DelCioppo, of Naples, Florida; * Christopher M. DelCioppo, of Tampa, Florida; * Vincent J. Lia, of Naples, Florida; * Duane P. Taylor, of Naples, Florida; and * Charles Trento, of Forked River, N.J. Abbey, John DelCioppo, Christopher DelCioppo, Lia, and Taylor, were all registered representatives in Goldmen's Naples, Florida office. Trento was a registered representative in Goldmen's New Jersey Office. Richard Walker, the Director of the Division of Enforcement said, ""We will spare no effort to close the doors of `boiler rooms' that fraudulently peddle stocks to unsuspecting investors and tarnish the reputation of our capital markets."" The order charges Goldmen, Marchiano, Winkler and the former registered representatives with five interrelated schemes that occurred between July 1994 to June 1998: First, from April 1997 to April 1998, Goldmen, Marchiano and Winkler conducted an unregistered offering of over 3 million shares of the common stock of Millennium Sports Management, Inc., a publicly-traded New Jersey corporation, and failed to deliver Millennium prospectuses to Goldmen's retail clients who bought Millennium stock during the unregistered offering. Goldmen raised net proceeds of at least $7.5 million through the sale of Millennium Stock during this period. Second, from July 1997 to June 1998, Marchiano, Abbey, John DelCioppo, Christopher DelCioppo, Lia, and Taylor engaged in a scheme to sell Millennium common stock to retail clients using a variety of fraudulent and deceptive sales practices. Under Marchiano's direction, Goldmen's Naples, Florida office became a ""boiler room"" that sold Millennium common stock through an aggressive cold-calling campaign involving high- pressure sales tactics, misrepresentations and omissions of material facts, baseless price predictions, unauthorized purchases, and an undisclosed no net- selling practice. Third, from July 1994 to February 1997, Winkler violated the antimanipulation provisions of the federal securities laws. During at least six initial public offerings (""IPOs"") underwritten by Goldmen, Winkler placed IPO securities into at least four nominee accounts. Winkler then had Goldmen immediately repurchase the securities after the IPOs at a substantial profit and resell them to bona fide investors at yet higher prices. While these IPO securities were in his nominee accounts, Winkler had Goldmen commence market making activities in the securities. The antimanipulation provisions of the federal securities laws prohibited Goldmen from engaging in such market making activity while IPO securities remained under Winkler's control in the nominee accounts. The Winkler nominee accounts made at least $250,000. Fourth, during the same period, Winkler and Marchiano violated the antimanipulation provisions in a similar scheme designed to resolve client complaints. Winkler and Marchiano placed IPO securities into the accounts of complaining clients during various IPOs underwritten by Goldmen and controlled the repurchase and resale of the securities, guaranteeing those clients a profit. While these securities remained under Winkler's and Marchiano's control in the client accounts, Goldmen commenced making markets in the securities. In one instance, Winkler and Marchiano placed nearly 30 percent of the IPO warrants into the accounts of complaining clients. This same scheme violated the antifraud provisions by creating a materially false impression of the nature and extent of investor interest in the offerings and aftermarket for the IPO securities. Fifth, from July 1994 to May 1997, Trento engaged in a pattern of fraudulent sales practices. These practices included: the use of nominee accounts to hide his financial interest in certain sales of securities; engaging in fraudulent cross-trading; making baseless price predictions; executing unauthorized and unsuitable trades; and engaging in an undisclosed no net-selling practice. In addition to the schemes described above, Winkler is charged with instructing certain Goldmen employees, including Goldmen's compliance director, to falsify, conceal and destroy various required books and records, including trade blotters, trade tickets, and customer complaints. The order alleges that Winkler did so to conceal from regulators, among other things, evidence of sales practice abuses, as well as other violations of federal and state securities laws. A hearing will be held before an administrative law judge to determine whether the allegations against the respondents are true and, if so, to determine what remedial sanctions are appropriate and in the public interest, and whether the respondents should be ordered to pay disgorgement and/or civil penalties. The Division of Enforcement thanks the New York County District Attorney's Office, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities for their assistance in the investigation. Also today, the New York County District Attorney's Office brought criminal charges against Goldmen and numerous former Goldmen brokers, employees, and others associated with the firm. The indictments include charges of enterprise corruption, schemes to defraud, criminal possession of stolen property, money laundering, and violations of the New York General Business Law. This enforcement action is one of several cases filed in an effort to address abuses in the offer and sale of microcap stocks. It is also part of the Commission's four-pronged approach to minimizing microcap fraud: enforcement, inspections, investor education and regulation.

5,"In response to a wave of so- called ""free stock"" offerings made through the Internet and a resulting flood of investor complaints, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought and settled four enforcement actions against four promoters and two Internet companies who offered and distributed free stock through online websites without properly registering their offerings. SEC Enforcement Director Richard H. Walker said, ""Free stock is really a misnomer in these cases. While cash did not change hands, the companies that issued the stock received valuable benefits. Under these circumstances, the securities laws entitle investors to full and fair disclosure, which they did not receive in these cases."" Mr. Walker also acknowledged the importance of complaints and tips received from investors regarding these cases, saying, ""The investors who write us and e-mail us through our homepage are an essential part of our enforcement program. Along with our CyberForce, they are our eyes and ears in cyberspace."" In each of the four cases, the investors were required to sign up with the issuers' web sites and disclose valuable personal information in order to obtain shares. Free stock recipients were also offered extra shares, in some cases, for soliciting additional investors or, in other cases, for linking their own websites to those of an issuer or purchasing services offered through an issuer. Through these techniques, issuers received value by spawning a fledgling public market for their shares, increasing their business, creating publicity, increasing traffic to their websites, and, in two cases, generating possible interest in projected public offerings. Two of these free stock issuers offered stock through websites that featured false claims. In one case, investors were told that the free shares they received would give them interests in an aerospace company that would revive lunar exploration. In fact, the company was never incorporated and its promoter had no space exploration or aerospace engineering experience. In another case involving an Internet telecommunications marketing firm, the website informed free stock recipients that their shares could eventually exceed $200 each in value, even though the firm had realized less than $30 in gross operating revenues. In each of the four administrative proceedings, the respondents consented, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission's orders, to settlements in which they agreed to cease and desist from future violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, respondents Joe Loofbourrow (promoter of American Space Corp.), Web Works Marketing.com, Inc. and Web Works founder Trace D. Cornell agreed to refrain from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Case Summaries and SEC Contact List 1. In the Matter of Joe Loofbourrow (SEC contact: Daniel J. Goldstein (212-748-8066)): The Commission's order finds that Loofbourrow, from July 1995 through the spring of 1999, via misleading Internet websites he created, offered investors free stock or other securities in his company American Space Corp., an unincorporated entity he intended to use to engage in space exploration and medical research. The offerings were not registered. Loofbourrow's websites touted his company as planning to build the largest aerospace manufacturing plant in the world and resume U.S. lunar exploration by the early 2000s, and proposing a subsidiary that would research cures for aging and all diseases. In addition, Loofbourrow stated, without reasonable basis, that the shares of free stock in American Space Corp. had a value of $1 each. In fact, American Space Corp. was never incorporated, and had no offices, employees or contracts. 2. In the Matter of Web Works Marketing.com, Inc. and Trace D. Cornell (SEC contact: Richard P. Murphy (404-842-7665)): The Commission's order finds that Cornell offered, through an Internet website, unregistered free shares in Web Works Marketing.com, Inc., a telecommunications marketing firm. On the Web Works website, Cornell informed investors that the shares they could receive by registering on his website or signing up for long distance service had a value of more than $38 per share and could appreciate to roughly $200 per share in value. Web Works' site further indicated that the company had 10,000-12,000 customers, held a contract with a Virginia-based long distance service provider and would provide investors with liquidity by conducting a future public stock offering. In fact, Web Works, which ran out of Cornell's home, had no contract with the long distance carrier, had only 35 customers, had less than $30 in gross revenues, and had taken no steps to effect a public offering. 3. In the Matter of WowAuction.com Inc. and Steven M. Gaddis, Sr. (SEC contact: Richard P. Murphy (404-842-7665)): The Commission's order finds that Gaddis, between March 1999 and May 1999, offered unregistered free stock in online auctioneer WowAuction.com Inc. to investors who registered with WowAuction's website or recruited others to register with the site. The site also informed investors that WowAuction.com would conduct a so- called ""direct public offering"" during the third quarter of 1999. 4. In the Matter of Theodore Sotirakis (SEC contact: Eric M. Schmidt (212-748-8046)): The Commission's order finds that, for a short period during April 1999, Sotirakis offered unregistered free stock in Kinesis International, Inc., an unincorporated business, to individuals who registered on the Kinesis website or linked their websites to Kinesis' site. In addition, investors could earn extra shares by referring additional registrants to the Kinesis site. At least 200 investors registered for free shares in the unincorporated business.",-0.02702702702702703,Negative
6,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued IG Holdings, Inc. for failing to consistently provide investors with adequate information in hundreds of so-called ""mini-tender offers."" Mini-tender offers are tender offers for less than 5 percent of a company's securities. Unlike tender offers for more than 5 percent, mini- tender offers are not subject to the filing, disclosure, and procedural requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation 14D. As a result, investors targeted for mini- tender offers typically don't receive documents that describe the tender offer in detail. The SEC alleged that, during 1998 and 1999, IG Holdings made more than 200 mini-tender offers that had offering prices below the prevailing market prices. The SEC further alleged that the means used to disseminate these offers resulted in some shareholders not receiving material information about IG Holdings' mini-tender offers, including the calculation of the final price to be paid by IG Holdings and the fact that the offering price might not reflect the market price. In addition, shareholders were not always informed that they could not withdraw their tenders, nor were they told that IG Holdings could revoke its offer at any time before completion of the offering. Without admitting or denying the SEC's charges, IG Holdings consented to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the federal securities laws. Securities and Exchange Commission Director of Enforcement Richard H. Walker said, ""Today's action serves as a warning to investors to monitor their investments carefully. Because the success of mini-tender offers depends on the offeror's ability to catch investors off guard, investors should take special care to scrutinize any offer for their securities. Don't assume you'll receive a premium over the market price if you tender your shares. Instead, do your homework and ask questions to find out whether the offer is a good deal or a rip-off."" To help investors learn which questions to ask about mini- tender offers, the SEC has released a new investor alert, Mini- Tender Offers: Beware of Offers to Buy Your Securities at Below Market Prices. This alert is available on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov/consumer/search.htm under the heading ""Search Key Topics,"" a searchable database of quick answers and solutions to common investor questions.

7,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged S. Jay Goldinger, once a well-known Beverly Hills-based money manager, with stealing $15.9 million from the Tustin, California-based public company PairGain Technologies, Inc. The theft occurred as part of a Ponzi-like scheme whereby Goldinger commingled the funds of PairGain and his other clients, then engaged in massive securities-futures trading misallocations. Through the scheme, which occurred during 1994 and 1995, Goldinger shifted tens of millions of dollars from some clients, including PairGain, to certain other clients while simultaneously generating enormous commissions and fees for himself. The Commission also today charged PairGain, a manufacturer of telecommunication products, and two of its top executives with failing to properly account for and timely disclose what initially appeared to be investment losses from unauthorized trading, but in reality were thefts by Goldinger. Also today, the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California announced that Goldinger has been charged with four felony counts of wire fraud in connection with his fraudulent trade misallocation scheme. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today also charged Goldinger and his brokerage firm, Capital Insight Brokerage, Inc., with commodities fraud. The U.S. Attorney further announced that PairGain has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count felony for failing to maintain internal accounting controls and accurate financial books and records in violation of the federal securities laws. The company was arraigned this morning and is scheduled to be sentenced this afternoon in Santa Ana, California. Richard H. Walker, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Today we are sending two messages. The first is a reminder of the simple proposition that if you steal -- even if by means of a complex investment scheme -- you will be criminally prosecuted. Second, public companies must ensure that they accurately and timely disclose their investment results. Even when public companies entrust their funds to well-known and supposedly reputable money managers, they must understand the trading strategy used, its objectives and associated risks, and closely monitor the results."" SEC Allegations The SEC's complaints, filed in the Central District of California, allege that: From September 1993 until November 1995, PairGain invested some of its excess cash with Goldinger, a well- known expert on U.S. Treasury securities. Goldinger told the company that he could outperform Treasury securities by using certain proprietary strategies. Goldinger misrepresented his strategy as fully hedged and low risk. Unbeknownst to anyone at PairGain, Goldinger was commingling the company's funds with other investors' funds, placing futures trades, and routinely shifting profitable trades to some clients and losses to other clients through massive trade misallocations. Goldinger's scheme eventually collapsed when he began to suffer overall trading losses, leaving PairGain and others with tens of millions of dollars in losses. In 1994, PairGain first became concerned about Goldinger's trading and learned that his options trading was highly risky. That year the company's trading account statements seemed to show large losses (due to Goldinger's trade misallocations), but account statements prepared by Goldinger appeared to reflect healthy profits. When questioned, Goldinger lied, claiming that PairGain had gains. Unable to determine what Goldinger was doing and uncertain whether the company had gains or losses, PairGain asked for its money back. Goldinger returned all the company's money with a sizable profitbut not through liquidating PairGain's investments, as he claimed. Rather he raised the money by secretly transferring profitable trades to PairGain through his misallocation scheme. The following year, 1995, PairGain invested $28.1 million with Goldinger but told him to buy only short- maturity Treasury securities. Instead, Goldinger covertly shifted almost all of the company's money to other clients who wanted to cash out or whose accounts he had previously plundered. By early June 1995, the company again questioned Goldinger's trading. When confronted, Goldinger admitted that he had engaged in unauthorized options trading. Goldinger then told the company that it would have a very sizable loss if he liquidated PairGain's investments by the end of June (the company's quarter-end). PairGain believed that its losses would be approximately $2 million if Goldinger liquidated. In reality, the losses amounted to $26 million and were from Goldinger's improper shifting of losing trades to the company. The company never attempted to independently verify the amount and reasons for its losses. Instead, for the next five months (from July through mid-November 1995) PairGain relied solely on Goldinger's version of events. PairGain instructed Goldinger to try to recoup the company's losses, and to do so Goldinger placed increasingly-heavy risky bets in Treasury options for PairGain's account. At the same time, PairGain failed to properly account for and disclose its investment losses in two quarterly filings with the Commission and falsely stated that its funds were held in investment grade, interest bearing securities. All the while, PairGain, its chairman and former chief executive officer, Charles S. Strauch, and its chief financial officer, Charles W. McBrayer, each knew or was reckless in not knowing that the company had material investment losses and that its remaining funds were exposed on risky options. Finally, in December 1995, after Goldinger told PairGain that he could not recover any more of the company's funds, PairGain disclosed that it had lost $15.9 million on investments with Goldinger. SEC Settlements: Simultaneously with the filing of the SEC's complaints and its administrative proceedings against PairGain, the following settlements were agreed to: S. Jay Goldinger: Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Goldinger agreed not to violate the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws, and agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains (plus prejudgment interest thereon) and pay civil money penalties in amounts to be determined later. Goldinger has also agreed to a bar from associating with any securities broker or dealer. PairGain Technologies, Inc.: Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, PairGain consented to a Commission order directing the company to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions. Charles S. Strauch and Charles W. McBrayer: Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Strauch and McBrayer agreed not to violate the antifraud provisions. In addition, McBrayer agreed not to violate the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions. Strauch and McBrayer have each also agreed to pay civil money penalties of $25,000. Other Settlements * CFTC's Settlement with Goldinger: Goldinger agreed not to violate the antifraud provisions of the federal commodities and futures laws and to pay $6 million in disgorgement, offset by any payments made by Goldinger in his criminal case. * U.S. Attorney's Plea Agreement with PairGain: PairGain agreed to plead guilty to one felony count for failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls and failing to maintain accurate financial books and records. The company also agreed to four years probation and to pay $1.4 million ($1 million as a fine and $400,000 for the costs incurred by the government for investigating and prosecuting this matter). PairGain also agreed to do the following during its probation: * retain, within 60 days, an expert to examine and make recommendations on the company's internal accounting controls and record-keeping; and * file with the SEC quarterly periodic reports and financial statements that (1) are reviewed by its outside accountants, (2) are signed by all members of the company's board except Strauch, and (3) are not prepared exclusively by Strauch and McBrayer. The Commission thanks the CFTC and the U.S. Attorney's Office for their cooperation in this matter. Details of the Commission's actions are available on the Internet at www.sec.gov.

8,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 99-173 SEC Charges New York Pension Fund Manager in $6.9 Million Kickback Scheme Los Angeles, CA, December 16, 1999 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has sued New York pension fund manager Alan B. Bond for fraudulently receiving more than $6.9 million in kickbacks from brokerage firms in connection with his management of the pension and investment funds of such notable clients as the National Basketball Association, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority and the City University of New York. Bond, Harvard educated and a frequent guest on PBS's Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser, used the kickbacks to purchase more than 75 luxury and antique automobiles and a large home and beachfront condominium in Florida. Also today, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has criminally charged Bond, and the second defendant in this lawsuit, Robert I. Spruill, for conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint. The SEC's complaint, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, from September 1993 through November 1998, Bond received over $6.9 million in commission kickbacks from three brokerage firms. Bond directed trades to these firms through his former money management business, Bond, Procope Capital Management. The kickbacks he received were siphoned off the investment returns of his clients in the form of mark-ups on principal trades in the over-the-counter market. According to the complaint, Bond dictated to the brokerage firms the amount of the mark-up on each trade and the firms, in turn, kicked back 57-80% of the mark-ups to Bond. In most cases, the kickbacks were funneled through dummy corporations set up by Spruill, who worked as a broker at these firms. Bond then instructed the firms not to report the mark-ups on his clients' trade confirmations and account statements. ""By choosing to direct trades to these firms, Bond was not only deciding when he received a kickback, he was also deciding how much the kickbacks would be, while at the same time preventing his clients from detecting the scheme,"" said Valerie Caproni, Pacific Regional Director of the SEC. The SEC's complaint further alleges that most of the money in this scheme went to finance Bond's extremely lavish personal lifestyle. In addition to the 75 cars and the two real estate properties in Florida, Bond frequently went on shopping sprees at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co., running up American Express bills of $200,000 to $470,000 a month. He spent several hundred thousand dollars remodeling and furnishing his various homes. He also hired an interior designer to decorate the warehouse that he used to store his classic cars. Bond also used some of the illicit payments to purchase gratuities for the trustees and employees of his pension fund clients. The gratuities included limousine service, overnight stays in posh New York City hotels, expensive clothing and tickets to sporting events. According to the complaint, Bond had approximately 25 clients and over $600 million under management. The clients were mostly union and government pension funds. Bond's largest client was a retirement fund for Washington, DC's transit workers. Ms. Caproni said, ""Although Mr. Bond's clients were mostly pension funds, the victims are human. Mr. Bond's scheme affected the life savings and financial security of thousands of working people, such as police officers, fire fighters, teachers and bus drivers. People who believed that their pension fund adviser was investing for their benefit, not his. We bring this case as a way of saying to all investment professionals: `If you're thinking of lining your own pockets with other people's money, don't. We will find you and stop you.'"" As part of its lawsuit, the SEC charged Bond with violating, and Spruill with aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Bond was also charged with filing false documents with the SEC. The lawsuit is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties against the defendants. The SEC acknowledges the valuable assistance the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the United States Postal Inspection Service in bringing this case.

11,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today brought and settled securities charges against three current and one former Washington, DC-area law students and a Colorado Springs, CO city councilwoman for their involvement in an Internet price manipulation scheme, which generated more than $345,000 in illegal profits. The architect of the fraud, Douglas Colt, was charged in federal court with committing securities fraud. Administrative proceedings were brought against the four other individuals for conduct that contributed to Colt's violations. The SEC alleges that Douglas Colt created ""Fast-trades.com,"" a stock recommendation web site, which he used to manipulate the price of four stocks during February and March 1999. The SEC alleges that Colt created a scheme in which he recommended stocks on the Fast-trades web site to drive up their short-term prices, sometimes by as much as 700 percent. By trading in advance of his stock recommendations, Colt generated more than $345,000 in total profits for himself, his mother Joanne Colt, three of his law school classmates, and two of his friends. At times, some of them garnered profits exceeding 500 percent within an hour of the recommendation. The SEC alleges that Douglas Colt targeted low-priced, thinly-traded stocks knowing that his trades and subscriber activity would artificially increase the price of the stocks selected. Douglas Colt and the other scheme participants allegedly purchased their selected stocks and entered sell limit orders before recommending the stocks to Fast-trades subscribers, whose numbers grew to more than 9,000 by the end of the scheme. The SEC contends that within a few hours of the recommendations to Fast-Trades subscribers, the Fast-Trades participants had ""dumped"" their shares at a profit. The stock prices subsequently plummeted in a matter of hours. The SEC contends that subscriber purchases were essential to the scheme. The SEC alleges that to attract new subscribers, Douglas Colt and three of his law school classmates -- Kenneth Terrell, Jason Wyckoff and Adam Altman -- promoted the website by collectively posting hundreds of false messages to various Internet message boards, including boards on the Yahoo! and Raging Bull web sites. The SEC contends that these messages disguised the authors' connection with the Fast-trades site and misrepresented the investment success they achieved from following Fast-Trades' recommendations. In addition, the SEC alleges that Douglas Colt posted a false ""track record"" on the Fast-Trades website touting the performance of several stocks he falsely claimed were Fast-Trades selections. Richard H. Walker, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The Internet has replaced the boiler room as the stock manipulator's tool of choice. Its low cost and ease of use has attracted a new breed of persons seeking to profit at the expense of innocent investors. People who commit fraud on the Internet will quickly learn that the Enforcement Division will aggressively attack attempts to undermine the integrity of our markets. Ridding the Internet of securities fraud is a top priority of the SEC."" According to the SEC's allegations, in late April, 1999, Douglas Colt boldly posted on an Internet message board unrelated to Fast-trades an eleven-point ""blueprint"" for how to commit a price manipulation scheme. His ""posting"" noted that someone who wanted to manipulate the price of a security could, among other things, ""screen for thinly traded stocks in the $1 to $2 price range; ... look for one with a ... low ... volume ...; pull together information from optimistic press releases; throw in some bull",-0.42857142857142855,Negative
12,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2000-124 SEC Continues Nationwide Crackdown Against Internet Fraud, Charging 33 Companies and Individuals With Fraud For Manipulating Microcap Stocks Fourth Internet Sweep Brings to More Than 180 the Total Number of Internet Cases Filed Washington, DC, September 6, 2000 In its fourth nationwide Internet fraud sweep, the Securities and Exchange Commission today announced 15 enforcement actions against 33 companies and individuals who used the Internet to defraud investors by engaging in pump-and-dump stock manipulations. The perpetrators of these market manipulations ""pumped"" up the total market capitalization of those stocks involved by more than $1.7 billion. The actions involve the stocks of more than 70 microcap companies and illegal profits of more than $10 million. The cases include 11 civil actions filed in U.S. District Courts throughout the country and four related administrative proceedings. SEC Director of Enforcement Richard H. Walker said, ""What used to require a network of professional promoters and brokers, banks of telephones and months to accomplish can now be done in minutes by a single person using the Internet and a home computer. Thinly traded microcap stocks are particularly susceptible to online manipulations. That's why we have made this area one of our highest enforcement priorities. Ultimately, however, the best way for investors to protect themselves against all forms of Internet fraud, including pump-and-dump schemes, is to do their homework and to be highly skeptical of information they receive from strangers on Internet websites, message boards and chat rooms."" Today the SEC also released an online brochure to warn investors about stock market fraud on the web. ""Pump&Dump.Con: Tips for Avoiding Stock Scams on the Internet"" advises investors to be skeptical, consider the source, and independently verify web-based claims about stocks. The brochure is available at www.sec.gov/consumer/iemmtips.htm. The cases brought today involve individuals and small entities that spread false information through electronic newsletters, websites, email messages, and through posts on Internet message boards. Some of the respondents have no securities industry experience; one of them is a bus mechanic, another a college student who is also a driver for a car service. Several of today's actions involve foreign entities and individuals who used the Internet to reach U.S. investors. The sweep also includes a complaint the Commission filed in mid- August alleging a pump-and-dump scheme primarily orchestrated by two recidivists. SEC v. Broadband Wireless International Corp. et al., Civil Action No. 00-1375-R (USDC/W.D. Okl). This case required an emergency action filed by the SEC and state regulators to halt the scheme and freeze the assets of the defendants. Today's actions are part of the fourth nationwide Internet fraud sweep conducted by the SEC. Previous sweeps filed in October 1998 and February 1999 dealt with the unlawful touting of publicly-traded companies via the Internet, while a sweep in May 1999 targeted the sale of bogus securities over the Internet. The SEC has now brought more than 180 Internet-related enforcement actions. More than one-third of these have been brought in the last year.

Thor Equity Group, LLC and George E. Mahfouz, Jr. (U.S. District Court, District of Arizona) In the Matter of CancerOption.com, Inc. and Arnold C. Takemoto (SEC Contact: Donald Hoerl, 303-844-1060) The SEC alleges that George E. Mahfouz, Jr. and his investor relations firm, Thor Equity Group, touted securities of CancerOption.com, Inc. based on false financial and stock price projections and then sold large amounts of the stock at inflated prices for illicit profits of more than $180,000. CancerOption and Mahfouz provided analysts with false information used in reports recommending CancerOption stock to investors. Mahfouz and Thor Equity then posted the reports on CancerOption's website, and hired touters to spread false information over the Internet. The SEC also alleges that Arnold C. Takemoto, then chief executive of CancerOption, reviewed these reports, knew them to be false, but took no steps to remove them from the company's website. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mahfouz and Thor Equity consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and Mahfouz consented to the entry of an order requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of over $180,000. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CancerOption and Takemoto consented to the entry of an order which requires them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation or any future violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. 2. SEC v. Lee E. Gahr and Chill Tech Industries, Inc. (U.S. District Court, District of Nevada) (SEC Contact: Donald Hoerl, 303-844-1060) The SEC alleges that Chill Tech Industries, Inc., through its chief operating officer Lee E. Gahr (a resident of Vancouver, Canada), made numerous false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts through an Internet website, various press releases, phony unsolicited faxes, and a magazine article. These statements concerned, among other things, the ""environmentally friendly"" nature of Chill Tech's ""Arctic Can,"" allegedly a self-cooling beverage can. The Arctic Can actually used Freon, a banned substance. The SEC alleges that all the fraudulent statements were drafted or reviewed by Gahr, who ran the company pursuant to a management agreement. Certain of these statements caused the price and volume of Chill Tech stock to increase between 15 percent and 94 percent in the short term. While Gahr was disseminating the false press releases, he personally sold 1,056,500 restricted shares of Chill Tech common stock for a profit of $277,136. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against Gahr and Chill Tech as well as disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty against Gahr. 3. SEC v. Christopher P. Hastings d/b/a/ Stockpicks1 (U.S. District Court, District of Kansas) (SEC Contact: Donald Hoerl, 303-844-1060) The SEC alleges that Christopher Hastings, using the screen name ""Stockpicks1,"" touted the stock of ten issuers through a free email newsletter (with up to 400 subscribers), on an Internet website he maintained, and in messages he posted on various Internet message boards. Hastings included false and misleading data on his website concerning the track record for his stock picks, which he claimed averaged a 410 percent increase after his touts. Further, Hastings also misrepresented his trading intentions in Internet message board postings and email messages. In two instances, Hastings sold his personal holdings of the touted stocks into the resulting inflated market for total profits of approximately $70,309. Hastings also coordinated his touting with other touters against whom the SEC obtained a preliminary injunction in April 2000. Hastings has no experience in the securities industry; he is currently employed as a school bus mechanic. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hastings has consented to the entry of an order that enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The order also requires him to disgorge $70,309 plus prejudgment interest, but waives payment of disgorgement of all but $22,312 and does not impose a civil penalty based on his demonstrated inability to pay. 4. SEC v. Rajiv Vohra, Sean T. Healey, Lantern Investments, Ltd., Lipton Holdings, Ltd. and Beaufort Holdings, Ltd. (U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida) In the Matter of Scott Eskew In the Matter of Platinum Equities, Inc., Blackhealth & Kent Holdings, Inc., John Kenny and Pasquale Forti (SEC Contact: Richard P. Murphy, 404-842-7665) The SEC alleges two schemes to defraud investors in connection with the sale of stock in New Directions Manufacturing, Inc., a small furniture manufacturing company. Two groups that acted both independently and, at times, together, perpetrated the schemes. The first scheme involved Rajiv Vohra and Sean Healey who acquired blocks of free-trading shares of New Directions and then used ""wash sales"" (they bought and sold shares of New Directions between accounts they controlled) to create the appearance of active trading in the stock. They then published false and misleading information on the Internet to promote the stock while they were selling their shares at a profit of more than $500,000. Vohra and Healey attempted to conceal their scheme by conducting much of their activity through Canadian brokerage accounts held in the name of three Bahamian companies they controlled. Scott Eskew permitted Vohra and Healey to use his name and falsely characterize him as an independent analyst who recommended the stock in a research report published over the Internet. Vohra and Healey paid Eskew $1,500 for his cooperation. The SEC has accepted Eskew's offer of settlement to consent, without admitting or denying the charges, to a cease-and-desist order. The second scheme involved Platinum Equities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer in New York City, its two principals, John Kenny and Pasquale Forti, and its parent company, Blackheath & Kent Holdings, Inc., who all acquired a large quantity of New Directions shares. Kenny and Forti opened an account at another brokerage firm, in the name of Blackheath & Kent, to park the stock until they could resell it to their customers. When soliciting investments in New Directions stock from customers at Platinum Equities, Kenny and Forti concealed their ownership of the stock. Platinum Equities' customers paid over $1,000,000 for the stock they purchased from Kenny and Forti. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Vohra, Healey, and the Bahamian companies under their control, restraining them from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, an accounting, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties. The SEC also has instituted cease-and-desist and administrative proceedings against Platinum Equities, Blackheath & Kent, Kenny and Forti to determine what remedial action should be taken against them, whether an accounting and disgorgement plus reasonable interest should be ordered, whether civil monetary penalties should be imposed against them, whether cease-and-desist orders should be issued, and whether Kenny and Forti should be suspended or barred from participating in an offering of penny stock. 5. SEC v. Heartsoft, Inc., Benjamin Shell and Jimmy Butler (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Oklahoma) (SEC Contact: Spencer Barasch, 817-978-6425) The SEC alleges that, Benjamin P. Shell and Jimmy Butler, the principals of Heartsoft, Inc. (a developer and marketer of educational software) issued a series of fraudulent press releases that were simultaneously posted on Heartsoft's website. These releases included a myriad of false and misleading statements. During the relevant period, Heartsoft's stock price increased more than 1500 percent from $.21 to nearly $6.00 per share as a result of the false and misleading press releases. The SEC alleges that these releases were, in fact, the only public information available to investors, because the company had not filed any of its required quarterly or annual reports with the SEC from May 1, 1997 until November 1999. Further, Shell and Butler profited from their fraudulent conduct by dumping substantial amounts of their Heartsoft stock, from which they made more than $160,000 in illicit profits. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Heartsoft, Shell and Butler have consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and Shell and Butler have agreed to disgorge all of their trading profits, pay prejudgment interest, and pay civil monetary penalties of $50,000 each. In addition, Heartsoft has agreed to provide all public disclosures to outside counsel for review prior to release for a period of four years. 6. SEC v. Gursel Mandaci (U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York) (SEC Contact: Robert Blackburn, 212-748-8185) The SEC alleges that from February to April 2000, Gursel Mandaci, a college student and driver for a car service, used the Internet to inflate the price of securities that he had purchased in order to create short-term trading profits. Mandaci's strategy was to purchase penny stocks using a margin account he holds at an online broker, and then make large numbers of Internet postings that touted the issuers. These postings included false information about the issuers and baseless price predictions. Mandaci made more than $23,000 in six stocks he manipulated, including one stock that increased in price from $0.01 to $0.38. The SEC has filed a civil injunctive action against Mandaci alleging violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks an order requiring Mandaci to pay disgorgement of $23,073 plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil monetary penalty. 7. SEC v. Donald Rutledge and Gregory Skufca (U.S. District Court, District of Colorado) In the Matter of John Black (SEC Contact: Wayne Carlin, 212-748-8178) The SEC alleges that Donald Rutledge, a Canadian promoter, and Gregory Skufca, an American shell company broker, embarked on a scheme to take public a development-stage company, Plus Solutions, Inc., at $5.00 per share without registering a public offering. Their plan was to increase Snelling Travel's float through a 29-for-1 stock split, and then merge Plus Solutions into Snelling Travel, an over-the-counter issuer. Rutledge and Skufca intended to create the appearance of demand for the merged company's stock at prices of $5 or more per share, and then sell large quantities of the stock to the public. The SEC alleges that Rutledge and Skufca began to carry out the scheme, and engaged in some manipulative trading in the latter half of December 1999, which caused the stock to trade at more than $5 per share, and John Black, an employee of Rutledge, commenced a message ""thread"" (an area to post messages on a specific topic on an Internet bulletin board) about Snelling and posted two misleading messages on it. The scheme was derailed, however, because Snelling failed to comply with the NASD's notice requirements regarding stock splits. As a consequence of the resulting confusion over the effective date of the split, the proposed merger fell apart, and Snelling's stock price plummeted to pennies per share. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against Rutledge and Skufca prohibiting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The SEC also seeks disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, against Skufca, and civil monetary penalties against Rutledge and Skufca. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Black has consented to the entry of an order requiring Black to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933. 8. SEC v. Torsten Prochnow d/b/a/ Stockreporter.de, Dennis C. Hass and World of Internet.com AG (U.S. District Court, Northern District of California) (SEC Contact: Donald Hoerl, 303-844-1060) The SEC alleges that Torsten Prochnow and Dennis C. Hass, residents of Germany, touted the stocks of approximately 64 U.S. public companies under the name Stockreporter.de. The touts have been disseminated through postings on Stockreporter.de's Internet website and numerous press releases. As set forth in the complaint, Prochnow, Hass and WorldofInternet.com AG (a German corporation owned by Prochnow and Hass) targeted U.S. investors and these investors purchased the touted stocks based on the Stockreporter.de recommendations. The Stockreporter.de website contained false statements concerning the purportedly ""long-term"" trading intentions of Stockreporter.de's principals. The website also contained baseless financial and/or stock price projections concerning one of the touted issuers. The website also falsely stated that Stockreporter.de's principals were not compensated for their touting, and both the website and press releases failed to disclose both the nature and source of the compensation. The touts caused the price and trading volume of the stock of certain issuers to increase significantly in the short term. Baseless recommendations resulted in price and volume for 28 stocks increasing an average of between 28 percent and 390 percent. On at least 15 occasions, the SEC alleges that Prochnow and Hass sold their holdings of the touted stocks into the resulting inflated market, realizing profits of $111,530. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Prochnow and Hass have agreed to the entry of an order that enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b- 5 under the Exchange Act. The order also requires them, jointly and severally, to disgorge $111,520 plus prejudgment interest, and for each to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. 9. SEC v. Thomas Carter (U.S. District Court, Central District of California) (SEC Contact: Lisa Gok, 323-965-3835) The SEC alleges that Thomas Carter manipulated the prices of four securities that he owned by disseminating false material information about the companies. On each occasion, Carter disseminated a mass email purporting to be from a ""momentum trading service"" called the ""Unity List."" Carter's Unity List emails recited purported rumors about the touted companies and urged the email recipients to purchase the stocks at specified times. The emails also stated that the author planned to purchase large quantities of the stocks at the same times, implying that the author did not yet have a position in the securities. Contrary to the implications in his emails, Carter actually had purchased substantial positions in the stocks of the companies he touted prior to the times that he instructed his email recipients to purchase the stocks. After acquiring his stock, Carter sent out the emails to thousands of recipients. Many of the recipients acted upon the emails and purchased the profiled stocks and the stock price and trading volume rose dramatically. The SEC alleges that on each of the four occasions that he attempted to manipulate the price of a stock through this scheme, Carter sold his shares in the rising market for illicit profits of more than $12,000. The four stocks manipulated experienced the following price increases: one touted stock increased from $0.06 to $0.14 after dissemination of false report; another touted stock increased from $0.048 to $0.15; another from $0.04 to $0.13; and another from $0.075 to $0.10. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Carter for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The SEC also seeks disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty. 10. SEC v. Michael A. Furr (U.S. District Court, Central District of California) (SEC Contact: Donald Hoerl, 303-844-1060) The SEC alleges that Michael A. Furr, a paid promoter of penny stocks, orchestrated a manipulation scheme in which he touted at least 26 issuers on his free website, in printed research reports, through emails, and on a national radio show. For at least four of the issuers, Furr included false financial projections and made misrepresentations about an issuer's business ventures and assets. Furr also engaged in a fraudulent pattern of trading in the stock of at least 23 of the issuers, realizing proceeds of more than $3.4 million. The same day as, or within a few days of, issuing reports and emails with buy recommendations, Furr sold his stock in the recommended securities in a total of at least 751 trades without adequately disclosing his intention to sell. In addition, Furr either failed to disclose or misrepresented the compensation he received for touting the securities he recommended. Several of the stocks Furr touted experienced dramatic price increases: one touted stock increased from $0.13 to $3.38 after dissemination of the report; another increased from $0.18 to $1.26; another increased from $0.31 to $1.00; and another increased from $2.37 to $9.13. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Furr for violations of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The SEC also seeks disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty. 11. SEC v. Broadband Wireless International Corporation, BroadCom Wireless Communications Corporation, Ivan W. Webb and Donald L. Knight (U.S. District Court, Western District of Oklahoma; Civil Action No. 00-1375-R) (SEC Contact: Spencer Barasch, 817-978-6425) On August 11, 2000, the SEC filed an emergency enforcement action against Ivan Webb and Donald L. Knight, two recidivist securities laws violators engaged in an ongoing manipulation scheme involving the stock of Broadband Wireless International Corp, traded in the over-the-counter market under the symbol ""BBAN."" During the fall of 1999, Knight and Webb caused BBAN to issue several press releases and file reports with the SEC that fraudulently touted the company's purported acquisition of several private telecommunications companies, none of which ever came to fruition. Knight and Webb further hyped the company's stock on the company's website and on an Internet bulletin board. The promotional or ""pumping"" efforts resulted in a dramatic increase in the company's stock. Between late 1999 and February 2000, the stock price increased 10,000%, from 12 cents per share to over $12 per share. Concurrently, Knight, who is on criminal probation for a prior securities fraud scheme, sold or ""dumped"" millions of shares of restricted BBAN stock, reaping at least $5 million in illicit profits. Later in the scheme, Knight, in an effort to regain control over BBAN from Webb, conducted a fraudulent Internet proxy solicitation through BroadCom Wireless Communications Corp. (a company he controlled). On the same day the suit was filed, a federal court entered orders freezing the assets of all defendants and appointed a receiver to take control of BBAN and BroadCom. An Oklahoma U.S. Attorney simultaneously filed a petition to revoke Knight's criminal probation. The Commission also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties against Knight, BroadCom, Webb and BBAN.",-0.21621621621621623,Negative
13,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2000-153 SEC Charges Former Connecticut Treasurer and Ten Others Involved in Fraudulent Scheme in Connection with Investment of State Pension Fund Money; Three Defendants Agree To Settle Charges Boston, MA, October 10, 2000 - The Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a civil fraud action against Paul J. Silvester, the former Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, two private equity firms, three of their officers, and five others involved in a fraudulent scheme in connection with the investment of state pension fund money. The Commission alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme where Silvester awarded investments of hundreds of millions of dollars of state pension fund money in exchange for lucrative fees paid by the private equity firms to Silvester's friends and political associates. Juan Marcel Marcelino, District Administrator of the SEC's Boston District Office, said, ""Public pension funds result from the hard earned contributions of public employees. It is imperative that such funds be managed with complete honesty and integrity and for the sole benefit of the funds' beneficiaries. The SEC will vigorously pursue public officials and investment managers who violate the federal securities laws with respect to investment of public pension fund assets."" According to the complaint, Silvester, who served as Treasurer from July 1997 until January 1999, solicited two private equity firms, Landmark Partners, Inc. and Triumph Capital Group, Inc., to pay substantial consulting or finder's fees to Silvester's friends. In order to secure the investment of pension fund money, Landmark and Triumph agreed to pay the requested fees. Silvester then demanded and received kickbacks of the fees from his friends. The Commission alleged that Silvester, Triumph, Landmark, and certain of the firms' officers violated their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose the quid pro quo. Landmark is headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut. Triumph is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and also maintains offices in Hartford, Connecticut, Palm Beach, Florida, and San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. The complaint alleges that, in return for investing $150 million of state pension funds with Landmark in 1998, Silvester solicited and Landmark agreed to pay $1.5 million in finder's fees to Silvester's friend, Ben F. Andrews, Jr. Andrews agreed to kick back part of the finder's fee to Silvester using another friend of Silvester, Christopher A. Stack, as an intermediary. Andrews arranged for Landmark to split the finder's fee between him and Stack (who was paid through his consulting firm, KCATS, LLC), and Stack then funneled part of his Landmark fee to Silvester through an intermediary. Jerome L. Wilson, another Landmark consultant, acted as an intermediary in arranging for Landmark to hire and pay Andrews and Stack. Stanley F. Alfeld, chairman of Landmark, agreed to hire Andrews. Wilson later notified Alfeld that Andrews would split his fee with KCATS, Stack's consulting firm. At Alfeld's request, Wilson also arranged for his employer to act as a conduit for payment from Landmark to Andrews and Stack. The complaint also alleges that, in return for investing $200 million with Triumph shortly after losing the November 1998 election, Silvester solicited and Frederick W. McCarthy and Charles B. Spadoni, Triumph's president and general counsel, respectively, agreed to provide $1 million consulting contracts to Silvester's friends, Stack and Lisa Thiesfield. Stack then funneled part of his Triumph fee to Silvester through another intermediary. Silvester also requested and expected to receive part of Thiesfield's Triumph fee. According to the complaint, Silvester, Landmark, Alfeld, Wilson, Andrews, Stack, KCATS, Triumph, McCarthy, Spadoni, and Thiesfield, variously, violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and/or Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission seeks to enjoin each of the Defendants from continuing to violate or aid and abet violations of these laws. The Commission also seeks disgorgement of monies fraudulently received by Defendants Silvester, Andrews, Stack, KCATS, and Thiesfield, plus prejudgment interest. The Commission further seeks civil monetary penalties from each of the Defendants. Defendants Silvester, Stack and KCATS have agreed to settle the Commission's charges, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commission's complaint, by entering consent agreements that enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act. Silvester has agreed to pay $10,500, representing the proceeds he received from the conduct alleged in the complaint. Stack and KCATS have agreed, jointly and severally, to pay $300,667, representing the proceeds they received and retained from the conduct alleged in the complaint. Proposed final judgments by consent against Silvester, Stack and KCATS were filed with the complaint.

14,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in U.S. District Court in Miami, Florida charging 5 former officers of Sunbeam Corporation and the former engagement partner on the Arthur Andersen LLP audits of Sunbeam's financial statements with fraud, resulting in billions of dollars of investor losses. The defendants are: Sunbeam's former CEO and chairman Albert J. Dunlap; former principal financial officer Russell A. Kersh; former controller Robert J. Gluck; former vice-presidents Donald R. Uzzi; and Lee B. Griffith; and Arthur Andersen LLP partner Phillip Harlow. In related matters, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Sunbeam and its former General Counsel, David Fannin. The Commission's complaint in the injunctive action alleges that senior management of Sunbeam, led by Dunlap and Kersh, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to create the illusion of a successful restructuring of Sunbeam and thus facilitate a sale of the Company at an inflated price. According to the complaint, the defendants employed a laundry list of fraudulent techniques, including creating ""cookie jar"" revenues, recording revenue on contingent sales, accelerating sales from later periods into the present quarter, and using improper bill and hold transactions. Richard H. Walker, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, stated: ""Accurate and reliable financial reporting is the bedrock of our capital markets. This case is the latest in our ongoing fight against fraudulent earnings management practices that have caused investors billions of dollars in losses and threaten to undermine the integrity of our markets. As the case makes clear, we will attack such conduct aggressively in whatever guise it may appear (in this case, practices ranging from ""cookie jar"" reserves to channel stuffing) and against whomever may be involved (here, senior company management and the outside auditor)."" According to the Commission's Complaint: * Dunlap, a turnaround specialist, was hired by Sunbeam's Board in July 1996 to restructure the financially ailing Company. Dunlap placed Kersh in charge of Sunbeam's finance organization. Soon after their arrival, Dunlap and Kersh promised a rapid turnaround to enable Sunbeam to substantially improve its financial performance. Together with Sunbeam senior executives Gluck, Uzzi, and Griffith, they then employed improper accounting techniques and undisclosed non-recurring transactions to meet promised sales and earnings figures. These actions inflated the price of Sunbeam shares to a high of $52 per share in March 1998. If the Company had been sold at an inflated share price, Dunlap and Kersh could have reaped tens of millions of dollars from the sale of their Sunbeam securities. * The illegal conduct began at year-end 1996 with the creation by Kersh and Gluck of inappropriate accounting reserves, which increased Sunbeam's reported loss for 1996. These ""cookie-jar"" reserves were then used to inflate income in 1997, thus contributing to the false picture of a rapid turnaround. In addition, to further boost income in 1997, and to create the impression that Sunbeam was experiencing significant revenue growth, Dunlap, Kersh, Gluck, Uzzi, and Griffith (""the Sunbeam officers"") caused the Company to recognize revenue for sales that did not meet applicable accounting rules. As a result, for fiscal 1997, at least $60 million of Sunbeam's reported (record-setting) $189 million in earnings from continuing operations came from accounting fraud. * Also in 1997, the Sunbeam officers failed to disclose that Sunbeam's 1997 revenue growth was, in part, achieved at the expense of future results. The Company had offered discounts and other inducements to customers to sell merchan dise immediately that otherwise would have been sold in later periods, a practice also known as ""channel stuffing."" The resulting revenue shift threatened to suppress Sunbeam's future results of operations. * Phillip E. Harlow, a partner at Arthur Andersen, Sunbeam's outside auditing firm, authorized unqualified audit opinions on Sunbeam's 1996 and 1997 financial statements although he was aware of many of the Company's accounting improprieties and disclosure failures. * In early 1998, the Sunbeam officers took increasingly desperate measures to conceal the Company's mounting financial problems, meanwhile attempting to finance the acquisition of three other companies, in part through a bond offering. The Sunbeam officers again engaged in, and recognized revenue for, sales that did not meet the applicable accounting rules; again caused Sunbeam to engage in acceleration of sales revenue from later periods; deleted certain corporate records to conceal pending returns of merchandise; and misrepresented the Company's performance and future prospects in its filing on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 1998, its offering materials in connection with the bond offering, its press releases, and its communications with analysts. * In June 1998, negative statements in the press about the quality of the Company's earnings prompted Sunbeam's Board of Directors to begin an internal investigation. This resulted in the termination of Dunlap, Kersh and other members of Company management and, eventually, to an extensive restatement of Sunbeam's financial statements from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of 1998. Sunbeam is presently in a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the Commission's Complaint, through this conduct, Dunlap, Kersh, Gluck, Uzzi, and Griffith violated the anti-fraud, reporting and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission seeks, as to all defendants, permanent injunctions against future violations and civil penalties and, in the case of Dunlap, Kersh, Gluck, and Uzzi, permanent bars from acting as an officer or director of any public company. In a related matter, the Commission filed an administrative proceeding against Sunbeam Corporation, based in part on allegations that Sunbeam's filings with the Com mission were materially false and misleading from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of 1998. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Order Instituting Proceedings, Sunbeam consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order prohibiting future violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws. In another related matter, the Commission filed a settled administrative action against David C. Fannin, former Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secre tary of Sunbeam, based on allegations that Fannin participated in the drafting of certain Sunbeam press releases in early 1998 that presented a misleading picture of the Company's results of operations. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Fannin consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order prohibiting future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

15,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed four complaints in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that in 1999 and 2000, Edward A. Durante and other defendants manipulated the trading and generated artificial price rises in the stocks of four companies: U.N. Dollars Corp., WAMEX Holdings, Inc., Ramoil Management, Ltd., and Absolutefuture.com. Defendants reaped more than $30 million in illegal profits by secretly controlling the trading in these stocks through a network of promoters, brokers and market makers, and then by dumping the stocks at artificially inflated prices to unsuspecting investors. The filing of these complaints today comes as part of coordinated investigations by the staff in the Commission's Washington headquarters, New York and Boston offices, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which previously filed criminal charges concerning these schemes. The complaints allege that Edward Durante, using the name ""Ed Simmons,"" established an offshore finance company, Carib Securities Ltd., in 1999 to hide his personal involvement in the manipulation schemes. Additionally, Durante and others controlled several other entities, which they used to receive stock, engage in patterns of manipulative trading, and eventually to dump stock at artificially inflated prices. In particular, the complaints allege the following: * Durante manipulated the market for U.N. Dollars Corp. (""UNDR""), driving the stock price from one penny to over $1.25 before the Commission suspended trading in UNDR securities in March 2000. He contracted with UNDR's former executives to ""stimulate"" the company's stock price and trading volume, and in return, received 10 million newly-issued shares, which gave him control of UNDR's public float. He used brokerage accounts opened in the names of his offshore entities to purchase over 3 million additional shares, creating the false impression of a rising market for the stock, and later dumped the stock into the market for profits of approximately $100,000. * Durante and Roger DeTrano, a New York-based stock promoter, gained control of over 19 million shares of WAMEX Holdings, Inc. (""WAMX"") with the assistance of the company's executives. Durante drove the price for WAMX stock from $1.375 per share to an all-time high of $19.50, and dumped 6.9 million WAMX shares into the market for a $24 million profit, before the Commission suspended trading in WAMX securities in June 2000. Durante also engaged in illegal block trades, and hired an unregistered broker- dealer to push WAMX stock on unsuspecting investors. * Durante entered into an illegal funding scheme with Ramoil Management, Ltd. (""RAMO""), in which RAMO provided a million shares of its stock to Durante's offshore entities pursuant to sham consulting agreements. Durante had his broker for the offshore accounts execute a series of manipulative public trades in RAMO stock that moved RAMO's price from $7.0625 per share to an all-time high of $20.00. Durante dumped 1.8 million shares of RAMO into the market, making approximately $3.3 million. * Durante and DeTrano entered into an illegal funding scheme with Absolutefuture.com (""AFTI"") pursuant to which AFTI provided 4.1 million shares of its stock to entities controlled by Durante and DeTrano, pursuant to sham consulting agreements. Durante used those shares, along with an additional 3.3 million shares which he purchased on the market, to engage in manipulative trading activities, including matched orders and illegal block trades, which increased AFTI's stock price from $0.21 per share in December 1999 to $6.00 per share in March 2000, an increase of more than 2,700 percent. As a result of the conduct alleged in the complaints, Durante and his offshore entities, Carib Securities Ltd., Berkshire Capital Partners, Inc., Galton Scott & Golett Inc., Dottenhoff Financial Ltd., Zimenn Importing And Exporting Inc., Prudential Overseas Company, Ltd., Renaissance Gallery Inc., Fairmont Consulting, Ltd., Provident Partners Ltd., and Commonwealth Associates, Ltd. (all corporations controlled by Durante) are alleged to have violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, and the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of proceeds, prejudgment interest thereon, civil money penalties, and officer and director bars against Durante and others involved in the schemes. The complaints also allege that Durante stashed profits from his illegal stock trading with relief defendants Exchange Bank & Trust, Inc., a Nevis-based offshore private bank, and VJV Inc., a Nevada-based corporation owned by Durante. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the British Columbia Securities Commission in these matters.

17,"In its first pro forma financial reporting case, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted cease-and-desist proceedings against Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. for making misleading statements in the company's third-quarter 1999 earnings release. The Commission found that the release cited pro forma figures to tout the Company's purportedly positive results of operations but failed to disclose that those results were primarily attributable to an unusual one-time gain rather than to operations. ""This is the first Commission enforcement action addressing the abuse of pro forma earnings figures,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""In this case, the method of presenting the pro forma numbers and the positive spin the Company put on them were materially misleading. The case starkly illustrates how pro forma numbers can be used deceptively and the mischief that can cause."" Trump Hotels consented to the issuance of the Commission's order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. The Commission also found that Trump Hotels, through the conduct of its chief executive officer, its chief financial officer and its treasurer, violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act by knowingly or recklessly issuing a materially misleading press release. ""This case demonstrates the risks involved in mishandling pro forma reporting,"" said Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. ""Enforcement action can result if a company fails to disclose information necessary to assure that investors will not be misled by the pro forma numbers."" Specifically, as set forth in the Order, which is available on the Commission's website, the Commission found that: * On Oct. 25, 1999, Trump Hotels issued a press release announcing its quarterly results. The release used net income and earnings-per-share (EPS) figures that differed from net income and EPS calculated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), in that the figures expressly excluded a one-time charge. The earnings release was fraudulent because it created the false and misleading impression that the Company had exceeded earnings expectations primarily through operational improvements, when in fact it had not. * The release expressly stated that net income and EPS figures excluded a $81.4 million one-time charge. Although neither the earnings release nor the accompanying financial data used the term pro forma, the net income and EPS figures used in the release were pro forma numbers because they differed from such figures calculated in conformity with GAAP by excluding the one-time charge. By stating that this one-time charge was excluded from its stated net income, the Company implied that no other significant one-time items were included in that figure. * Contrary to the implication in the release, however, the stated net income included an undisclosed one-time gain of $17.2 million. The gain was the result of the termination, in September 1999, of the All Star CafÂ's lease of restaurant space at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City. Trump Hotels, through various subsidiaries, owns and operates the Taj Mahal and other casino resorts. The Company's executive offices are in New York City, and its business and financial operations are centered in Atlantic City. - Not only was there no mention of the one-time gain in the text of the release, but the financial data included in the release gave no indication of it, because all revenue items were reflected in a single line item. * The misleading impression created by the reference to the exclusion of the one-time charge and the undisclosed inclusion of the one-time gain was reinforced by the comparison in the earnings release of the stated earnings-per-share figure with analysts' earnings estimates and by statements in the release that the Company been successful in improving its operating performance. Using the non-GAAP, pro forma figures, the release announced that the Company's quarterly earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, stating: Net income increased to $ 14.0 million, or $ 0.63 per share, before a one-time Trump World's Fair charge, compared to $ 5.3 million or $ 0.24 per share in 1998. [Trump Hotels'] earnings per share of $ 0.63 exceeded First Call estimates of $ 0.54. * In addition, the release quoted Trump Hotels' chief executive officer as attributing the stated positive results and improvement from third-quarter 1998 to improvements in the Company's operations. * In fact, had the one-time gain been excluded from the quarterly pro forma results as well as the one-time charge, those results would have reflected a decline in revenues and net income and would have failed to meet analysts' expectations. The undisclosed one-time gain was thus material, because it represented the difference between positive trends in revenues and earnings and negative trends in revenues and earnings, and the difference between exceeding analysts' expectations and falling short of them. * On Oct. 25, the day the earnings release was issued, the price of the Company's stock rose 7.8 percent; subsequently, analysts learned of the one-time gain. On Oct. 28, the day on which an analysts' report and a news article revealing the impact of the one-time gain were published, the stock price fell approximately 6 percent. The Commission found that Trump Hotels violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Company was ordered to cease and desist from violating those provisions.

18,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2002-14 SEC CHARGES CSFB WITH ABUSIVE IPO ALLOCATION PRACTICES CSFB WILL PAY $100 MILLION TO SETTLE SEC AND NASD ACTIONS MILLIONS IN IPO PROFITS EXTRACTED FROM CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR ALLOCATIONS IN ""HOT"" DEALS Washington, D.C., January 22, 2002 Â The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (CSFB), the New York-based broker-dealer and investment bank, for abusive practices relating to the allocation of stock in ""hot"" initial public offerings (IPOs). The Commission simultaneously announced that CSFB agreed to pay a total of $100 million to resolve the Commission's charges and a related action by NASD Regulation, Inc. (NASDR). CSFB also agreed to be enjoined from future violations and to institute wide-ranging new procedures designed to prevent a recurrence of the sort of misconduct that gave rise to this action. ""In today's enforcement action the Commission has obtained one of the largest civil penalties ever imposed against a broker-dealer,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""CSFB improperly took advantage of its position as underwriter by allocating shares of hot IPOs to customers who agreed to share their IPO profits by paying excessive commissions,"" he added. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Commission charged CSFB with violating certain conduct rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) which prohibit profit- sharing in customer accounts and unjust or inequitable conduct. The Commission also charged that CSFB violated the SEC's books-and-records requirements for broker-dealers. ""The Commission has taken the unusual step of seeking a federal court injunction to enforce NASD rules in view of the nature and scale of the misconduct alleged in the complaint,"" said Wayne M. Carlin, director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. ""In contravention of the applicable rules, CSFB wrongfully obtained for itself tens of millions of dollars of its customers' IPO profits."" The complaint, which will be available on the SEC's website, includes the following allegations: * CSFB, as the lead underwriter of hot IPOs for companies such as VA Linux Systems Inc., Selectica, Gadzooks Networks, and MP3.com, had control over the allocation of most of the shares in these IPOs. In exchange for some of the highly- coveted stock in such hot IPOs, CSFB wrongfully extracted from certain customers a large share of the huge profits those customers made in quickly selling (or flipping) the IPO stock bestowed on them by CSFB. * Specifically, CSFB allocated shares of IPOs to more than 100 customers who, in return, funneled between 33 and 65 percent of their IPO profits to CSFB. These customers typically flipped the stock on the day of the IPO, often gaining tremendous profits. They then transferred a share of their flipping profits to CSFB by way of excessively high brokerage commissions (ranging from $0.19 per share to $3.15 per share Â in contrast to the typical rate of about $0.06 per share). The customers paid these commissions on uneconomic, limited-risk trades in highly liquid, exchange- traded shares unrelated to the IPO shares Â trades that they effected for the sole purpose of paying IPO flipping profits back to CSFB. * The profit-sharing activity was pervasive at CSFB. Senior executives who were in managerial and supervisory roles knew of the practices described in the complaint, encouraged many of the practices described in the complaint, directed CSFB employees to urge customers to maintain specified ratios of commissions to IPO profits, and, in some instances, personally engaged in some of the practices described in the complaint. * CSFB employees informed the relevant customers, both implicitly and explicitly, that they were expected to pay back to CSFB a portion of profits earned on their IPO flipping in order to continue to receive allocations. Customers who refused to funnel a portion of their profits to CSFB received smaller allocations, and in some instances were denied allocations altogether. The prevalence of CSFB's abusive practices is reflected in numerous e-mail messages and other communications, examples of which are cited in the complaint. * The profit-sharing customers received no more than 10 percent of the IPO stock allocated by CSFB in each offering. IPO flipping was so profitable, however, that CSFB wrongfully obtained tens of millions of dollars in IPO profits through this improper conduct. ""In the midst of the hot IPO market between April 1999 and June 2000, CSFB extracted a significant sum of money from a relatively small segment of the marketplace,"" Carlin said. ""CSFB saw that some people were willing to do just about anything to get IPO stock, and CSFB improperly took advantage of the circumstances to take for itself a share of its own customers' profits."" CSFB has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement terms are subject to approval by the court. CSFB has agreed to pay a total of $100 million to settle the Commission's action and a related action announced today by NASDR. Specifically, CSFB will pay disgorgement totaling $70 million. In addition, CSFB will pay civil penalties and fines totaling $30 million. CSFB has consented to be enjoined from violations of NASD Conduct Rules 2110 (prohibiting violation of just and equitable principles of trade) and 2330 (prohibiting sharing in the profits of customer accounts), as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder (broker- dealer books and records). Finally, CSFB has undertaken to change its methods of allocating IPO stock, as well as its supervision of those activities. Among other things, CSFB will (1) implement extensive new policies and procedures relating to the allocation of IPO shares, the customer account opening process, commission levels, and related supervisory practices; (2) retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of CSFB's new policies and procedures after one year; and (3) adopt the recommendations of the independent consultant. ""This matter was a model of effective cooperation and parallel investigation by our staff and the staff of NASDR,"" Cutler said. ""We are most grateful for NASDR's extraordinary work on the enforcement actions announced today."" The Commission also acknowledged the invaluable assistance provided by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in the investigation of this matter.

19,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged iCapital Markets LLC, formerly Datek Securities Corp., with securities fraud and widespread violations of the CommissionÂs broker-dealer books and records and reporting provisions. The Commission censured the firm and ordered iCapital to pay a $6.3 million penalty. iCapital consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings contained in it, and to the relief imposed. The Commission found that from at least 1993 through March 1998, when it sold its day-trading business, Datek Securities engaged in a widespread fraudulent scheme by illegally executing proprietary trades through the Nasdaq Stock MarketÂs Small Order Execution System (SOES). The SOES system was designed for small public customers, and until last year, a broker-dealer was prohibited from using the SOES system to trade for its own account. The SOES system was the only Nasdaq trading system that offered automatic execution at the best available price. ÂTodayÂs tough action by the Commission underscores the obligations of a broker-dealer to speak truthfully to the securities markets and to regulators,Â said William R. Baker III, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. By hiding its use of the SOES system for proprietary trading, Datek Securities obtained SOES automatic execution which, combined with Datek SecuritiesÂ day-trading software, gave it a significant advantage. The Commission found that Datek Securities fraudulently used the SOES system to execute millions of proprietary trades, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in trading profits. Datek Securities accomplished the fraud through the use of sophisticated software, dozens of nominee accounts, concealment and misrepresentations to regulators, fictitious books and records, and false reports filed with the Commission. The CommissionÂs order finds that: From at least 1993 through March 1998, Datek SecuritiesÂ New York City branch, the profit center for the entire firm, operated as a day-trading firm. Unlike other day-trading firms that provide services for customers who trade for their own accounts, Datek Securities traders traded for firm proprietary accounts. Datek SecuritiesÂ volume of proprietary trading through SOES was enormous: from 1995 through March 1998, Datek Securities trades constituted over 30 percent of all SOES trades. To hide its proprietary trading, Datek Securities set up nominee accounts and paid the nominees for the use of their identities and complete discretionary trading. Initially, nominees provided their own funds to set up the accounts, and Datek Securities promised to pay them a fixed rate of return. In 1997 undisclosed principals of the firm began funding nominee accounts with profits from the illegal SOES scheme. Between May 1997 and March 1998, the undisclosed principals capitalized over 125 nominee accounts with a total of at least $50 million. Nominees received payments from Datek Securities for the use of their identities. In 1995 and 1996, Datek Securities distributed over $200 million to undisclosed principals of the firm. Datek falsely recorded and reported the distribution of trading profits, which were made to companies owned by the principals, as expenses for Âcomputer services.Â The Commission found that, from at least 1993 through March 1998, Datek Securities willfully violated: The antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by devising and implementing the fraudulent scheme to gain access to and use the SOES system for proprietary trading; Broker-dealer record-keeping provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3(a)(1), 17a-3(a)(2), 17a- 3(a)(3), 17a-3(a)(7), 17a-3(a)(9), and 17a-3(a)(12), by creating and maintaining false books and records that allocated proprietary trades to nominee accounts, recorded trades as customer trades, failed to reflect the true beneficial owner of the nominee accounts, improperly recorded the distribution of trading profits, and failed to maintain accurate forms relating to its traders; Broker-dealer reporting provisions, Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-5(a) and (d), by filing FOCUS reports and annual audited financial statements that were inaccurate as a result of the systematic allocation of trades and the improper classification of the distribution of trading profits; Broker-dealer reporting provisions, Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b3-1, by filing Forms BD and amendments to these forms that concealed and failed to disclose the control persons of the firm; and Broker-dealer provisions, Section 15(b) and Rule 15b7-1, by permitting unregistered traders to purchase and sell securities, and by employing supervisors who never passed the requisite supervisory examinations, or who supervised Datek Securities employees even after they were no longer officially registered with Datek Securities.

On March 30, 1998, Datek Securities sold the assets of its day-trading business to Heartland Securities Corp.

21,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday filed fraud charges against career swindler Clif GoldsteinÂlong known to criminal law authorities as ÂDr. NoeÂÂfor bilking at least 20 investors out of nearly $1.1 million in an elaborate fraud known as a prime bank scheme. The lawsuit also names GoldsteinÂs older brother, Paul Howe Noe, and two Boca Raton, Fla. companies run by the brothers, Great American Trust Co. and Great American Trust Corp. ÂDr. Noe,Â whose multi-million dollar swindles have been widely chronicled in U.S. newspapers and abroad for decades, is a high school dropout from Texas who has sometimes claimed to be highly educated in order to gain the confidence of his victims. Goldstein, 71, formerly Clifford Dixon Noe, has a criminal record as a con man that dates back to the 1970s that includes multiple convictions and prison sentences for wire fraud, mail fraud and forgery. GoldsteinÂs brother, Paul Noe, 74, also has an extensive criminal record, including convictions and prison sentences for embezzlement, larceny and wire fraud. The SEC complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Columbia, S.C., alleges that Goldstein, Noe and their companies sold wholly fictitious securities that they described as Âstand-by letters of creditÂ sold by Âtop ten European banks.Â Four other defendants named in the complaintÂCarolyn Kaplan, Noel Alelov, Russell B. Gerstein and Nuell W. PaschalÂserved as ÂfindersÂ who were paid for locating and luring potential victims. The prime bank schemes were promoted through in-person solicitations and over the Internet, according to the complaint. Victims who were targeted typically included individuals associated with cash-strapped companies in urgent need of financing and sophisticated investors looking for high returns in short periods of time. In some instances, the defendants promised to double investorsÂ money in 13 weeks. Instead, the complaint charges, they pocketed the money for their own personal use. In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, disgorgement of defendants' ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. In a related matter, the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina filed criminal charges against Goldstein, Noe, Gerstein and Paschal for their roles in the alleged investment scheme, and they have been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent days. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the South Carolina Offices of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney. Additional information about the case can be found in Litigation Release No. 17362.

22,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an action charging Frank D. Gruttadauria, former branch manager for the Cleveland, Ohio, office of Lehman Bros. Inc., with securities fraud. The CommissionÂs complaint alleges that over the last six years, while he worked at two different brokerage firms, Gruttadauria, 44, of Gates Mills, Ohio, stole at least $40 million in the course of defrauding more than 50 clients. Also charged with securities fraud were two entities controlled by Gruttadauria -- DH Strategic Partners Inc. and JYM Trading Trust -- which Gruttadauria allegedly used to misappropriate the funds from his clients. The Commission is seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, asset freezes, accountings, the appointment of a receiver for Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners, and JYM Trading Trust, as well as other emergency relief. A hearing on the CommissionÂs motions has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 26, in U.S. District Court in Cleveland. The CommissionÂs complaint alleges that over a period of many years, Gruttadauria falsely told customers that he had bought or sold securities for their accounts, when, in fact, he had misappropriated their funds for his own purposes. He is also accused of materially misrepresenting the value of and the positions held in customer accounts, often falsely telling customers that their accounts contained a wide variety of holdings worth millions of dollars. In some instances, Gruttadauria induced customers to give him funds by claiming that he had opened accounts for them when, in fact, no account ever existed for the client and he simply misappropriated the funds. The complaint alleges that Gruttadauria misappropriated funds from customers and directed the funds to other customers either as purported returns on non-existent investments or to satisfy withdrawal requests from accounts as to which Gruttadauria had deceived the account holders into believing that they had sufficient funds to make transfers. In particular, from at least 1996 through October 2000, while employed at Cowen & Co. and SG Cowen Securities Corporation, Gruttadauria misappropriated over $25 million in customer funds by fraudulently directing the money into an account that he controlled in the name of JYM Trading Trust, and using it to make payments to other customers. Beginning in October 2000, Gruttadauria similarly misappropriated and funneled over $15 million in customer funds through a bank account he controlled in the name of DH Strategic Partners. The complaint further alleges that, to conceal his fraud, Gruttadauria created and sent defrauded customers unauthorized and falsified account statements that greatly overstated the value of the customersÂ accounts, reflected holdings that did not exist and securities transactions that had never occurred, and failed to disclose the unauthorized withdrawals from the accounts. The most recent false statements for the accounts of at least 50 of GruttadauriaÂs customers reflected an aggregate value of about $278 million, whereas the actual value of accounts held for these customers at Lehman Brothers was about $1.8 million. Without the knowledge or authorization of these customers, Gruttadauria allegedly caused their actual brokerage account statements to be sent to entities or post office boxes under his control. The CommissionÂs complaint charges Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners and JYM Trading Trust with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also names as relief defendants Sarah Z. Emamy, a resident of Gates Mills, Ohio; Laurene U. English, GruttadauriaÂs former sales assistant, and Charlie Whiskey LLC, a limited liability company of which Gruttadauria is a 50% owner, and which owns a Lear Jet.

In particular, from at least 1996 through October 2000, while employed at Cowen & Co. and SG Cowen Securities Corporation, Gruttadauria misappropriated over $25 million in customer funds by fraudulently directing the money into an account that he controlled in the name of JYM Trading Trust, and using it to make payments to other customers. Beginning in October 2000, Gruttadauria similarly misappropriated and funneled over $15 million in customer funds through a bank account he controlled in the name of DH Strategic Partners. The complaint further alleges that, to conceal his fraud, Gruttadauria created and sent defrauded customers unauthorized and falsified account statements that greatly overstated the value of the customersÂ accounts, reflected holdings that did not exist and securities transactions that had never occurred, and failed to disclose the unauthorized withdrawals from the accounts. The most recent false statements for the accounts of at least 50 of GruttadauriaÂs customers reflected an aggregate value of about $278 million, whereas the actual value of accounts held for these customers at Lehman Brothers was about $1.8 million. Without the knowledge or authorization of these customers, Gruttadauria allegedly caused their actual brokerage account statements to be sent to entities or post office boxes under his control. The CommissionÂs complaint charges Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners and JYM Trading Trust with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also names as relief defendants Sarah Z. Emamy, a resident of Gates Mills, Ohio; Laurene U. English, GruttadauriaÂs former sales assistant, and Charlie Whiskey LLC, a limited liability company of which Gruttadauria is a 50% owner, and which owns a Lear Jet. The complaint alleges that Gruttadauria unjustly enriched the relief defendants by transferring to them over $3.4 million in money and assets derived from his illegal conduct. [SEC v. Frank D.

34,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges in separate cases against former executives at three northern California software companies for perpetrating financial accounting frauds at those companies. Among those named were the former chief executive officer of Quintus Corp., the former chief executive and chief financial officers of Unify Corp., and former senior sales executives of Legato Systems, Inc. Also today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced criminal charges against former officers at Quintus and Unify for their roles in the frauds. ""Two of these cases involve CEOs who engaged in conduct that can only be described as shocking, including forging contracts, purchase orders and other documents, or entering into undisclosed side letters to falsely boost a company's revenue,"" said Helane L. Morrison, District Administrator for the Commission's San Francisco District Office. ""Today's actions emphasize the Commission's commitment to hold such executives responsible for the choices they make and the enormous harm they cause, including by depriving them of compensation they received as a result of their fraud."" Charles D. Niemeier, Chief Accountant in the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Unify is significant as an example in the software industry of the use of 'roundtrip' transactions to create a false impression of business activity and revenue."" Niemeier continued, ""Unify engaged in `roundtripping' by repeatedly providing funds to customers so that they could purchase product from the company, with no reasonable expectation that the customers would ever repay the funds. These transactions produced no economic benefit to shareholders, and were done solely to inflate Unify's reported revenue, in order to deceive investors."" The Commission filed complaints in each of the actions in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. The complaints allege the following misconduct. The Commission brought fraud charges against former Quintus CEO Alan K. Anderson, 40, of Walnut Creek, Calif. Quintus was a Dublin, Calif. based developer of customer relationship management software. According to the complaint, from December 1999 through October 2000 Anderson personally forged contracts, e-mails, purchase orders, letters, and an audit confirmation in order to boost Quintus' financial results. Anderson created three fake transactions that ranged in value from $2 million to $7 million, for a total of $13.7 million in nonexistent sales. In addition, Anderson caused Quintus to recognize improperly $3 million in revenue on a barter transaction, which was contingent on Quintus' agreement to purchase $4 million of product from its customer. In each case, Anderson caused Quintus to recognize revenue in violation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In one instance, Anderson altered a $1.5 million purchase order to make it appear that the customer had actually ordered $6 million worth of Quintus products and services. In another, Anderson forged a contract and a purchase letter to make it appear that the a reseller had agreed to pay Quintus $7 million up-front, rather than the truth-that the reseller would pay Quintus only if the reseller was able to sell Quintus product to end users. As a result of Anderson's fraud, Quintus overstated its revenue in three fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 37% to 60% per quarter. In February 2001, NASDAQ delisted Quintus' stock, and the company is now being liquidated through bankruptcy proceedings. The complaint charges Anderson with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and with lying to Quintus' outside auditors. The complaint also seeks an injunction against future violations, disgorgement of bonuses Anderson received based on the company's fraudulent financial performance, monetary penalties and an order barring Anderson from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company. In addition, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it has charged Anderson with one count of securities fraud, based on the fraud at Quintus. The Commission brought fraud charges against former Unify CEO Gholamreza (Reza) Mikailli, 49, of Saratoga, Calif., and former CFO Gary L. Pado, 38, of Sacramento, Calif. Sacramento based Unify develops and sells database management software. The complaint alleges that from May 1999 through May 2000, Mikailli and Pado caused Unify to recognize revenue fraudulently on transactions that they knew were subject to contingencies (including rights of return or cancellation), or involved barter transactions. Under GAAP, it was improper for Unify to recognize revenue on contingent transactions so long as the contingencies existed and, thus, could nullify or impair the sale. Also under GAAP, it was improper for Unify to recognize revenue on barter transactions because Unify's revenue was contingent on Unify's performance of its obligation to the customer. In several instances Mikailli and Pado engaged in ""roundtripping,"" by causing Unify to provide funds its customers needed to buy Unify products, with no reasonable expectation that the customers would ever repay the funds. In some instances, Unify made an investment in another company, which then used most or all of the invested funds to purchase Unify product. In others, Unify contracted for services from other companies through so-called Funded Development Agreements. However, the companies provided no such services, and simply used funds from Unify to buy Unify product. As a result of the fraud, Unify overstated its revenue over four fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 61% to 150% per quarter. During the course of the fraud, Mikailli sold all of his shares of Unify stock and received gross proceeds of approximately $8.2 million. Mikailli illegally failed to file any reports with the Commission during this period disclosing his stock sales. The complaint charges Mikailli and Pado with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting and bookkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws and with lying to Unify's outside auditors. It also charges Mikailli with insider trading and failing to file required reports relating to sales of shares by insiders. The complaint seeks injunctions, monetary penalties and officer and director bars against Mikailli and Pado. In addition, the complaint seeks disgorgement from Mikailli of all amounts he received as a result of the fraud, including losses avoided by his stock sales, sales commissions he received on fraudulent transactions, and bonuses. Also named in the complaint was Unify, for violations of the corporate reporting and bookkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations. In addition, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it has charged Mikailli and Pado with criminal securities fraud, based on the fraud at Unify. The Commission brought fraud charges against former Legato executive vice president of worldwide sales David Malmstedt, 46, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and former vice president of North American sales Mark Huetteman, 39, of Hinsdale, Illinois. Legato, based in Mountain View, Calif., develops and sells software for managing the data storage functions of computer networks. The complaint alleges that from May 1999 through December 2000, Malmstedt and Huetteman caused Legato fraudulently to record millions of dollars in revenue on orders that were contingent on resellers' ability to sell the product to an end customer, or on customers' rights of exchange, return or cancellation. As a result of the fraud, Legato overstated its revenue over three fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 6% to 20% per quarter. In one instance, Malmstedt and Huetteman caused Legato to recognize revenue on a $7 million purchase order that was contingent on further successful negotiations between the parties. Pursuant to this arrangement, if the negotiations broke down, the customer had the right to cancel the purchase order. The cancellation right was set forth in a separate side letter, drafted by Huetteman, which stated in part: ""This contingency may not be expressly stated in the order letter, because of the impact on revenue recognition. However, you have my assurance that in the event that we can not [sic] reach terms we will not hold you to the commitment to pay referenced in the order letter."" The complaint charges Malmstedt and Huetteman with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting and bookkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement of losses avoided on sales of Legato stock by Malmstedt and Huetteman during the course of the fraud, and monetary penalties. In a related matter, the Commission issued an order instituting and simultaneously settling cease-and-desist proceedings against Legato and its former CFO, Steven Wise, 47, of Mountain View, Calif. Legato and Wise consented to the issuance of the Commission order without admitting or denying any of its findings. The order found that Legato violated the corporate reporting, bookkeeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, the order found that Wise caused Legato's violations of these provisions, and that Wise knowingly failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls at the company. The order requires Legato and Wise to cease and desist from future violations of these provisions.

35,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today brought a settled administrative enforcement action against Microsoft Corp. ordering the company to cease and desist from committing accounting violations and other violations of federal securities laws. In the Order for this proceeding, the Commission found that Microsoft had maintained seven reserve accounts in a manner that did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). More particularly, the Commission found that these reserves did not comply with GAAP because, to a material extent, they did not have adequately substantiated bases. As a result, Microsoft misstated its income by material amounts in certain periodic filings with the Commission made between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1998. The Commission also found that Microsoft did not properly document the bases for these accounts and failed to maintain proper internal controls, as required by the federal securities laws. ""This case emphasizes that the Commission will act against a public company that issues financial statements with material inaccuracies, even in the absence of fraud charges,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""Public companies must ensure that their accounting is substantiated in the first instance by factual bases and well-reasoned analyses and conclusions. In order to do so, companies must properly document the bases for their reserves and other accounting entries, so that they and their auditors can verify that the accounting is proper; and they must maintain appropriate internal controls, so that this verification will occur in the normal course of business.""

37,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Samuel Waksal, the former CEO of ImClone Systems Inc., for illegal insider trading. In its complaint, the Commission charges that Waksal received disappointing news late last December that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would soon issue a decision rejecting for review ImClone's pending application to market its cancer treatment drug, Erbitux. The SEC further charges that Waksal told this negative information to certain family members who sold ImClone stock before the news became public and that Waksal himself tried to sell shares of ImClone before the news became public. In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Commission seeks an order requiring that Waksal disgorge the several million dollars in losses avoided by those family members he tipped, and that he pay civil penalties and prejudgment interest. It also seeks an order permanently enjoining Waksal from violating the securities laws, and barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

39,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission issued the following statement regarding the conviction of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP: Today, a jury in Houston, Texas, found Arthur Andersen LLP guilty of obstruction of justice. The Commission is deeply troubled by the underlying events that resulted in Andersen's conviction, especially insofar as the verdict reflects the jury's conclusion that Andersen engaged in conduct designed to obstruct SEC processes. In light of the jury verdict and the underlying events, Andersen has informed the Commission that it will cease practicing before the Commission by Aug. 31, 2002, unless the Commission determines another date is appropriate. In the interim, the orders and rules the Commission announced on March 14 and released on March 18, 2002, following the indictment of Andersen remain in effect, and Andersen may continue to make required filings on behalf of its clients in compliance with those rules and orders, which contain provisions ensuring continuing Andersen quality control procedures. The Commission hopes this action will minimize any potential disruption to the capital markets and the affected issuers while those issuers complete certain pending or future filings, offerings and other activities. This relief is procedural in nature, is of finite duration and is intended solely to address temporary disruptions that the affected issuers may face as a result of Andersen's conviction. The Commission continues to monitor closely these developments, particularly with respect to Andersen's public company clients who are in the process of having their financial statements audited. We have an obligation to protect investors, and, as we are announcing today, we have taken necessary actions to assure a continuing and orderly flow of information to investors and the capital markets.

The Commission is deeply troubled by the underlying events that resulted in Andersen's conviction, especially insofar as the verdict reflects the jury's conclusion that Andersen engaged in conduct designed to obstruct SEC processes. In light of the jury verdict and the underlying events, Andersen has informed the Commission that it will cease practicing before the Commission by Aug. 31, 2002, unless the Commission determines another date is appropriate. In the interim, the orders and rules the Commission announced on March 14 and released on March 18, 2002, following the indictment of Andersen remain in effect, and Andersen may continue to make required filings on behalf of its clients in compliance with those rules and orders, which contain provisions ensuring continuing Andersen quality control procedures. The Commission hopes this action will minimize any potential disruption to the capital markets and the affected issuers while those issuers complete certain pending or future filings, offerings and other activities. This relief is procedural in nature, is of finite duration and is intended solely to address temporary disruptions that the affected issuers may face as a result of Andersen's conviction. The Commission continues to monitor closely these developments, particularly with respect to Andersen's public company clients who are in the process of having their financial statements audited. We have an obligation to protect investors, and, as we are announcing today, we have taken necessary actions to assure a continuing and orderly flow of information to investors and the capital markets.

44,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed accounting fraud charges against several former senior executives of Rite Aid Corp. The U. S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania simultaneously announced related criminal charges. The Commission's complaint charges former CEO Martin Grass, former CFO Frank Bergonzi and former Vice Chairman Franklin Brown with conducting a wide-ranging accounting fraud scheme. The complaint alleges that Rite Aid overstated its income in every quarter from May 1997 to May 1999, by massive amounts. When the wrongdoing was ultimately discovered, Rite Aid was forced to restate its pre-tax income by $2.3 billion and net income by $1.6 billion, the largest restatement ever recorded. The complaint also charges that Grass caused Rite Aid to fail to disclose several related-party transactions, in which Grass sought to enrich himself at the expense of Rite Aid's shareholders. Finally, the Commission alleges that Grass fabricated Finance Committee minutes for a meeting that never occurred, in connection with a corporate loan transaction. The Commission is seeking disgorgement of annual bonuses and imposition of civil penalties against Grass, Bergonzi and Brown. The Commission also seeks an order permanently enjoining each defendant from violating the securities laws and barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Commission also announced settled administrative cease-and-desist proceedings against Rite Aid and against Timothy Noonan, the company's former Chief Operating Officer. Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, stated: The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, alleges as follows: In the injunctive action, the Commission charges Grass, Bergonzi and Brown with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder; and, as controlling persons of Rite Aid, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. The complaint also charges Bergonzi, as a controlling person, with violations of Rule 13a-13 under the Exchange Act; and charges Grass and Brown, as controlling persons, with violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11 and 14a-9(a) thereunder. The settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Rite Aid, in which the company neither admits nor denies the Commission's findings, makes findings that Rite Aid violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. In the settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Noonan, in which Noonan neither admits nor denies the Commission's findings, the Commission finds that Noonan violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and caused violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Both respondents are ordered to cease and desist from future violations. In determining the appropriate resolution of these proceedings, the Commission considered the substantial cooperation provided by Rite Aid and Noonan in the investigation of this matter. The Commission acknowledges the invaluable assistance it received in this investigation from the Office of Thomas A. Marino, the U. S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Contact:Wayne M. CarlinÃ Ã Ã (646) 428-1510Caren Nelson PenningtonÃ Ã Ã (646) 428-1845",-0.65,Negative

55,"\- On July 2, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission abrogated proposals by several markets to extend rebates of market data revenues to market participants. Under Commission rules, if the markets re-file these proposals, the Commission would publish notices in the Federal Register and the public would be invited to comment on them. The Commission is concerned that the availability of large market data revenue rebates in certain markets may be creating incentives for traders to engage in transactions with no economic purpose other than to receive market data fees. The Commission believes that such trades may be distorting the actual volume of trading in these securities. Moreover, the Commission is concerned that the structure and size of market data revenue rebates may be distorting the reporting of trades, and that these rebate programs may reduce the regulatory resources of the markets and reallocate the funding of regulation among participants. This action today will allow the Commission to consider the effects of market data revenues and the underlying issues presented by the manner in which market data is collected and distributed and the amount that vendors are charged for this information. Specifically, the Commission abrogated rules filed by the National Association of Securities Dealers (File Numbers NASD 2002-61 and 2002-68), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange (File Number CSE 2002-06) and the Pacific Exchange (File Number PCX 2002-37).

Rigas; and two senior executives at Adelphia, James R. Brown, and Michael C. Mulcahey, in one of the most extensive financial frauds ever to take place at a public company. In its complaint, the Commission charges that Adelphia, at the direction of the individual defendants: (1) fraudulently excluded billions of dollars in liabilities from its consolidated financial statements by hiding them on the books of off-balance sheet affiliates; (2) falsified operations statistics and inflated earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations; and (3) concealed rampant self-dealing by the Rigas Family, including the undisclosed use of corporate funds for Rigas Family stock purchases and the acquisition of luxury condominiums in New York and elsewhere. Also today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed related criminal charges against several of the same defendants. In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Adelphia is the sixth largest cable television provider in the United States and, through various subsidiaries, provides cable television and local telephone service to customers in 32 states and Puerto Rico. The Commission seeks a judgment ordering the defendants to account for and disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including all compensation received by the individual defendants during the fraud, all property unlawfully taken from Adelphia by the individual defendants through undisclosed related-party transactions, and any severance payments related to the individual defendants' resignations from the company. The Commission also seeks civil penalties from each defendant, and permanent injunctions against violating the securities laws. The Commission further seeks an order barring each of the individual defendants from acting as an officer or director of a public company. ""This case presents a deeply troubling picture of greed and deception at a large, publicly-held company,"" said SEC Director of Enforcement Stephen M. Cutler. ""The Commission and the criminal authorities have responded to this egregious conduct with swift, strong and coordinated enforcement action and prosecutions."" The Director of the SEC's Northeast Regional Office Wayne M. Carlin said: ""In this case, Adelphia not only failed early on to cooperate with the Commission's investigation, but actually allowed the fraud to continue until the Rigas family lost control over the company's conduct. The Commission's request for civil penalties against Adelphia - an unusual step against a public company - is all the more appropriate in light of that fact."" Specifically, the Commission's complaint alleges as follows: The Commission alleges that the defendants continued their fraud even after Adelphia acknowledged, on March 27, 2002, that it had excluded several billion dollars in liabilities from its balance sheet. The defendants allegedly covered-up their conduct and secretly diverted $174 million in Adelphia funds to pay personal margin loans of Rigas Family members. When Adelphia failed to file its 2001 Form 10-K through the Spring, the price of Adelphia's stock collapsed from a closing price of $20.39 per share on March 26, 2002 to a closing price of $.79 on June 3, 2002, when the NASDAQ delisted the stock. Adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on June 25, 2002. The Commission's investigation is continuing.

59,"Schemes Took in Approximately $30 MillionThe Commission alleges that the offerings were fraudulent because the issuers employed nationwide networks of telemarketers, called Independent Sales Offices or ISOs, to sell the offerings and paid them undisclosed cash commissions ranging from 20% to as high as half of the offering proceeds. According to the SEC's complaints, these excessive commissions violated express representations contained in offering materials, which falsely stated that the issuers would use most of the offering proceeds for business purposes. When the offering materials did mention sales commissions, they significantly understated the portion of offering proceeds that issuers agreed to pay broker-dealers. The Commission's complaints charge the issuers and their principals, the individuals and entities who managed the offerings by recruiting and organizing the networks of ISOs, the ISO operators, and two attorneys. Simultaneously, in related criminal prosecutions, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York announced the unsealing of indictments containing criminal charges against 46 defendants for the same fraudulent schemes. ""These cases demonstrate the need for investors to be extremely skeptical when they are solicited to invest over the phone by an unfamiliar caller,"" said Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. ""Skepticism should be greater when the investment is not registered with the Commission. Here, the investors were deceived into believing that their money would go to the development of various business enterprises when, in fact, a quarter to a half of each investor's funds went to enrich telemarketers."" Each of the SEC's four complaints charges a separate group of related schemes. These four groups are as follows: The Commission alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the provisions of the Securities Act that require registration of non-exempt securities offerings, and the provisions of the Exchange Act that require registration of broker-dealers. The Commission seeks injunctions, disgorgement of illegal commissions and other ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

60,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it had charged Michael J. Kopper, a former high-ranking Enron official, with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Kopper has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and to be barred permanently from acting as an officer or director of a public company. As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, Kopper will disgorge and forfeit a total of approximately $12 million. The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, which filed related criminal charges against Kopper. Kopper agreed to enter a guilty plea in connection with those charges and to cooperate with the government's continuing investigation. ""This is the first in what we anticipate to be a series of actions brought as the result of the close cooperation between the SEC and the Justice Department's Enron Task Force,"" said SEC Enforcement Division Director, Stephen M. Cutler. ""We will continue to work diligently and vigorously with the Task Force to make sure that all those responsible answer for their misdeeds. We anticipate that the cooperation Mr. Kopper has agreed to provide will be important in identifying fully the individuals and entities that contributed to the company's collapse."" SEC Enforcement Division Deputy Director Linda Chatman Thomsen added, ""The transactions described in the complaint illustrate the financial and accounting machinations employed by Enron to create the illusion of stellar corporate performance. The intricate nature of this scheme reflects the sophisticated efforts of Mr. Kopper and others to conceal from the public their illegal activity."" As alleged in the complaint, starting in at least early 1997, Kopper and others used complex structures, straw men, hidden payments, and secret loans to create the appearance that certain entities that Kopper and others at Enron funded and controlled were independent of Enron. This allowed Enron to move its interests in these entities off its balance sheet when, in fact, those interests should have been consolidated into Enron's financial statements. As a result, Enron's financial statements did not properly reflect Enron's interest in these entities, thereby enabling Enron to engage in various transactions with these entities that were designed to improve its apparent financial results.

61,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it had charged Michael J. Kopper, a former high-ranking Enron official, with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Kopper has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and to be barred permanently from acting as an officer or director of a public company. As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, Kopper will disgorge and forfeit a total of approximately $12 million. The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, which filed related criminal charges against Kopper. Kopper agreed to enter a guilty plea in connection with those charges and to cooperate with the government's continuing investigation. ""This is the first in what we anticipate to be a series of actions brought as the result of the close cooperation between the SEC and the Justice Department's Enron Task Force,"" said SEC Enforcement Division Director, Stephen M. Cutler. ""We will continue to work diligently and vigorously with the Task Force to make sure that all those responsible answer for their misdeeds. We anticipate that the cooperation Mr. Kopper has agreed to provide will be important in identifying fully the individuals and entities that contributed to the company's collapse."" SEC Enforcement Division Deputy Director Linda Chatman Thomsen added, ""The transactions described in the complaint illustrate the financial and accounting machinations employed by Enron to create the illusion of stellar corporate performance. The intricate nature of this scheme reflects the sophisticated efforts of Mr. Kopper and others to conceal from the public their illegal activity."" As alleged in the complaint, starting in at least early 1997, Kopper and others used complex structures, straw men, hidden payments, and secret loans to create the appearance that certain entities that Kopper and others at Enron funded and controlled were independent of Enron. This allowed Enron to move its interests in these entities off its balance sheet when, in fact, those interests should have been consolidated into Enron's financial statements. As a result, Enron's financial statements did not properly reflect Enron's interest in these entities, thereby enabling Enron to engage in various transactions with these entities that were designed to improve its apparent financial results.

They later caused Tyco to forgive tens of millions of dollars they owed the company, again without disclosure to investors as required by the federal securities laws. Belnick, according to the complaint, failed to disclose that he received more than $14 million in interest-free loans from the company to acquire two residences in New York City and Park City, Utah.

67,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against three former senior executives of Homestore Inc. (formerly Homestore.com Inc.), based in Westlake Village, Calif., for perpetrating an extensive scheme to fraudulently inflate Homestore's online advertising revenues in 2001. The complaint, filed today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, charges that John Giesecke Jr., Homestore's former chief operating officer; Joseph J. Shew, its former chief financial officer; and John DeSimone, its former vice president of transactions, caused Homestore to overstate its advertising revenues by $46 million (64%) for the first three quarters of 2001. This action was brought in coordination with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which simultaneously announced related criminal charges against the three defendants. Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone have each agreed to settle the Commission's lawsuit, to plead guilty to the criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in its continuing investigation. At the time of the violations, Homestore was one of the top Internet portals for real estate and related services. The Commission's complaint charges Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone with arranging fraudulent ""round-trip"" transactions for the sole purpose of artificially inflating Homestore's revenues in order to exceed Wall Street analysts' expectations. The defendants circumvented applicable accounting principles and lied to Homestore's independent auditors about these transactions. While the fraud was ongoing, the defendants exercised stock options at prices ranging between approximately $21 and $32 per share, reaping profits ranging from approximately $169,000 to approximately $3.2 million. Randall R. Lee, Regional Director of the Commission's Pacific Regional Office, stated: ""Today's action is the first against Homestore executives for using sham, round- trip transactions to inflate Homestore's operating results. Their fraud misled the public by creating the illusion that Homestore's revenues were growing at a time when many dot-com companies were in decline or had failed. Corporate executives who participate in the creation of accounting fiction willsuffer severe consequences. We have worked closely with the criminal authorities to bring this action expeditiously, and, in coordination with them, will continue to investigate others who may have participated in this fraud."" The Commission's complaint alleges as follows: Bogus Barter Transactions. Throughout 2000 and 2001, Homestore's sale of online advertisements was one of its primary revenue sources. Homestore engaged in a series of complex round-trip barter transactions to inflate revenues and meet Wall Street estimates. The essence of these transactions was a circular flow of money by which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue. Specifically, Homestore paid inflated sums to various vendors for services or products; in turn, the vendors used these funds to buy advertising from two media companies. The media companies then bought advertising from Homestore either on their own behalf or as agents for other advertisers. Homestore recorded the funds it received from the media companies as revenue in its financial statements, in violation of applicable accounting principles. As a result of a significant revenue shortfall in the first quarter of 2001, the company devised a plan to use a major media company as an intermediary in some round-trip transactions. The overall scheme required Homestore to ""refer"" vendors to the media company, and the vendors to purchase online advertisements from that company. In return, the major media company purchased online advertising from Homestore for which the media company acted as a media buyer. Using this structure, Homestore paid a total of $49.8million to various vendors in the first two quarters of 2001. These vendors then paid $45.1million to a major media company to purchase online advertisements. Homestore, in turn, recorded $36.7million in revenue from the major media company's related purchase of Homestore online advertisements. In short, Homestore recycled its own money to generate revenues. Homestore used this same general plan with another media company in the second and third quarters of 2001 to fraudulently recognize an additional $9.7 million in revenue. Charges Against the Defendants. In connection with these round-trip transactions, the SEC's complaint charges Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone with securities fraud, lying to the auditors, falsifying Homestore's books and records, and aiding and abetting Homestore's reporting and record-keeping violations. The complaint alleges that Giesecke, Shew and DeSimone knew that the round-trip transactions had no economic substance and that Homestore paid cash to numerous intermediaries for the primary purpose of selling advertising and recognizing revenue from these or related transactions. Nevertheless, Giesecke, Shew and DeSimone carried out the fraudulent plan and recorded, or caused the company to record, revenue on these bogus deals. All three defendants lied to the company's independent auditors about the round-trip transactions and withheld business records from the auditors during their 2001 quarterly reviews. Shew and Giesecke also misrepresented Homestore's revenues to securities analysts covering the company, while Giesecke approved press releases containing inflated revenue numbers. The individuals charged and the terms of their settlements are: The returned ill-gotten gains of approximately $4.6 million will be paid to the benefit of Homestore shareholders. In addition, the Commission is seeking the permission of the Court to have Giesecke's civil monetary penalty of $360,000 paid to the benefit of shareholders under the Fair Funds provision of the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In related proceedings filed today by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, Giesecke has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud, Shew has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy, and DeSimone has agreed to plead guilty to one count of securities fraud. Giesecke and DeSimone each face a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in prison, while Shew faces up to 5 years in prison. Their pleas are based on fraudulent conduct similar to that described in the Commission's complaint. As part of their plea agreements, all three defendants have agreed to cooperate with the Commission and the criminal authorities. The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Homestore because of its swift, extensive and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation. This cooperation included reporting its discovery of possible misconduct to the Commission immediately upon the audit committee's learning of it, conducting a thorough and independent internal investigation, sharing the results of that investigation with the government (including not asserting any applicable privileges and protections with respect to written materials furnished to the Commission staff), terminating responsible wrongdoers, and implementing remedial actions designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct. These actions, among others, significantly facilitated the Commission's expeditious investigation of this matter. This case is the product of an investigation by the SEC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.

74,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against Robertson Stephens Inc., a San Francisco-based brokerage firm and investment bank, relating to the firm's allocation of shares in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) during 1999 and 2000. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Robertson Stephen wrongfully obtained millions of dollars from over 100 customers by allocating shares of ""hot"" IPOs to these customers and receiving, in return, profits - in the form of excessive commissions or markdowns - made by these customers on their IPO stock. The Commission's complaint alleges that Robertson Stephens violated NASD Conduct Rules that prohibit profit sharing in customer accounts and unjust or inequitable conduct, as well as books and records requirements of the federal securities laws. In settlement of this matter, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robertson Stephens has agreed to pay a total of $28 million to resolve the Commission's action and a related action brought by the NASD. The firm also has agreed to be enjoined from future violations of the NASD rules and books and records provisions described above. The $28 million payment is composed of $23 million in disgorgement of improper gains and $5 million in civil penalties. In a separate case, the Commission filed a civil action against Paul Johnson, 42, a former managing director and senior research analyst at Robertson Stephens for issuing fraudulent research reports. The Commission alleges that Johnson issued research reports and made public statements regarding mergers proposed by two public companies in which he failed to disclose that he had conflicts of interest because he owned stock that, upon completion of each of the mergers, would yield enormous financial windfalls for Johnson. The Commission further alleges that, in 2001, Johnson issued false and misleading ""buy"" recommendations on another public company that were inconsistent with his privately held belief. In connection with the research reports, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Robertson Stephens. The Commission found that Robertson Stephens published materially misleading research reports in violation of Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 15c1-2(b), and Robertson Stephens failed reasonably to supervise a research analyst with a view toward preventing violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws arising from undisclosed conflicts of interest caused by the analyst's personal investments. The order also found that Robertson Stephens failed to preserve e-mails for the required three-year period and/or failed to preserve its e-mails in an accessible place for two years and failed promptly to furnish e-mails to the Commission. The Commission censured Robertson Stephens and ordered the firm to pay disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, of $885,000 and a penalty of $4,115,000, for a total of $5 million. Robertson Stephens consented to the entry of the order against it without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order. In the IPO matter, the Commission filed a civil action against Robertson Stephens in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging: Robertson Stephens consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that: (1) permanently enjoins Robertson Stephens from violating NASD Conduct Rules 2110 (just and equitable principles of trade) and 2330 (prohibition against profit-sharing), and Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3(a)(6); (2) orders Robertson Stephens to pay disgorgement of $23 million, which would be reduced to $11.5 million in recognition of the firm's payment of $11.5 million in the related NASD proceeding; and (3) orders Robertson Stephens to pay a civil penalty of $5 million, which would be reduced to $2.5 million in recognition of Robertson Stephens' payment of a $2.5 million penalty to NASD in its related proceeding. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD in the investigation of this matter. In a civil action filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission charged that former Robertson Stephens research analyst Paul Johnson provided positive research coverage in 1999 and 2000 on Redback Networks Inc. and Sycamore Networks Inc., after they had announced proposed mergers with private companies. Johnson praised both mergers in his research reports and media statements, but failed to disclose that his supposedly objective advice was infected by serious conflicts of interest. In both cases, he owned stock in the private companies that would be exchanged for public company shares if the mergers were completed, creating multimillion-dollar windfalls for Johnson. In acquiring his holdings in the private companies that were the subjects of the merger proposals, Johnson violated Robertson Stephens internal policy that required employees to obtain prior written approval from the firm for all private investments. Moreover, at the time that Johnson issued his reports and statements concerning the proposed mergers, he did not disclose to Robertson Stephens his personal holdings in the affected companies or the magnitude of his financial interest in the outcome of the mergers. The Complaint further alleges that in January 2001, Johnson spoke privately about Corvis Corp., another company that he covered, to a committee that was responsible for making investment decisions for a group of partnerships that had been formed by Robertson Stephens and senior Robertson Stephens executives in which Johnson and other senior Robertson Stephens executives were investors. In response to a question, Johnson told the committee that he would not buy Corvis stock at the prevailing market price, but would buy at a price that was approximately half of the current price. Johnson's statements to the committee directly contradicted his existing ""buy"" recommendation on Corvis. After Johnson spoke, the committee voted to sell all the Corvis stock held by two partnerships. In addition, the day after he made his private recommendation to the committee, Johnson sold nearly all of his Corvis stock. Two days after his stock sale, Johnson issued another research report reiterating his buy recommendation on Corvis, but failed to disclose that he had sold his Corvis stock. The complaint charges Johnson with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exhange Act Rule 10b-5, which prohibit the making of false or misleading statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. The Complaint also charges Johnson with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits the making of material false or misleading statements and failing to disclose material facts in the offer or sale of securities. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Johnson, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.",-0.5666666666666667,Negative
75,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Sheldon Maschler, Jeffrey A. Citron, Michael McCarty, Erik Maschler, and Heartland Securities Corp. with participating in an extensive fraudulent scheme involving the Nasdaq Stock Market's Small Order Execution System (SOES) from 1993 to June 2001. These defendants and others have agreed to pay over $70 million in penalties and disgorgement to settle the matter. Of the total penalties, Sheldon Maschler will pay approximately $29.2 million and Citron will pay approximately $22.5 million Ã¢ÂÂ among the largest penalty amounts the SEC has ever obtained from individuals. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC charged Sheldon Maschler, 58, Citron, 32, McCarty, 39, and Erik Maschler, 32, with securities fraud and violations of the Commission's broker-dealer books and records and reporting provisions. Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler devised and orchestrated the unlawful SOES trading scheme at the former Datek Securities Corp. from 1993 to March 1998. Maschler, McCarty, and Erik Maschler continued the scheme from April 1998 through June 2001 while in control of Heartland, which had purchased Datek Securities' day-trading business in March 1998. ""Today's action and hard-hitting penalties reinforce the high degree of integrity required of broker-dealers and persons associated with them,"" said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of Enforcement at the SEC. Until mid-2001, NASD rules restricted use of the SOES system to small retail customer orders, and prohibited broker-dealers from using SOES to trade for their own accounts. According to the complaint, Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler accessed the SOES system to execute millions of unlawful proprietary trades, generating tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits. These defendants hid their fraudulent use of the SOES system from regulators by allocating proprietary trades to dozens of nominee customer accounts, creating fictitious books and records, and filing false reports with the SEC. The SEC's complaint also charged Sheldon Maschler and McCarty in connection with a separate, yet similar, fraudulent scheme involving the conversion of three New York savings and loan institutions from mutual ownership to stock ownership. In violation of federal and state banking regulations, Maschler and McCarty entered into agreements with numerous depositors to obtain their subscription rights and then fraudulently used those rights to purchase shares of the banks' initial public offerings. Maschler and McCarty later sold the conversion stock on the open market, realizing illegal profits of $1,788,472. Defendants Raft Investments Inc. and JES Management Corp., a corporation owned by Sheldon Maschler, aided and abetted the bank conversion scheme by providing the funds used to obtain the depositors' subscription rights. The SEC's federal court complaint includes the following allegations: Defendants have agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement terms are subject to court approval. Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, Erik Maschler, and Heartland have consented to final judgments permanently enjoining each from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. They have also agreed to be enjoined from aiding and abetting violations of certain broker-dealer books and records and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. In addition, Sheldon Maschler has agreed to pay $29,201,808, Citron $22,462,929, Heartland $7,000,000, McCarty $1,497,529, and Erik Maschler $5,990,114 in civil penalties. Sheldon Maschler also has agreed to pay $2,355,304 and McCarty $69,664 in disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest for their participation in the savings and loan scheme. Elbogen and Zelcer have consented to final judgments enjoining each from aiding and abetting violations of certain books and records and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. In addition, Elbogen has agreed to pay $1,422,652 and Zelcer $150,000 in civil penalties. Raft Investments Inc. and JES Management Corp. have consented to final judgments enjoining each from aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants have also agreed to settle administrative proceedings that the SEC will institute based on the entry of the final judgments. Sheldon Maschler, Citron, McCarty, and Erik Maschler have agreed to the institution of proceedings and SEC orders that permanently bar each from associating with any broker or dealer. Heartland has agreed to an SEC order censuring the firm. Elbogen and Zelcer have agreed to SEC orders barring each from associating with any broker or dealer, with the right to reapply after two years in non-supervisory and non-proprietary capacities.

76,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued KPMG LLP and four KPMG partners - including the head of the firm's department of professional practice - in connection with the audits of Xerox Corp. from 1997 through 2000. The Commission's action, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the firm and four partners with fraud, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement of all fees and civil money penalties. The Commission alleges that KPMG and its partners permitted Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion ""gap"" between actual operating results and results reported to the investing public. Year after year, the defendants falsely represented to the public that their audits were conducted in accordance with applicable auditing standards and that Xerox's financial reports fairly represented the company's financial condition and were prepared in accordance with GAAP. ""The spectacular upheaval in the corporate landscape over the last year highlights the critical responsibility that auditors have in the financial reporting process,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of the Division of Enforcement. ""In their audits of Xerox, KPMG and its partners abdicated that responsibility."" ""The investing public counts on the audit profession to do their job with unfailing dedication to the principles of accounting, regardless of the wishes of their audit clients,"" said Paul R. Berger, an Associate Director of Enforcement. ""The failure by the audit firm and its partners in the Xerox case represents a troubling episode and one that cannot and should not be repeated."" The four partners named as defendants, all of whom are certified public accountants, are: According to the complaint (a more detailed recitation of the complaint's allegations is attached): KPMG affiliate offices in Europe, Brazil, Canada and Japan, as well as KPMG auditors at Xerox's main U.S. operations facility in Rochester, N.Y., repeatedly warned the defendant KPMG partners, who had overall responsibility for the Xerox audit engagement, that manipulative actions taken by Xerox to improve revenues and earnings were unnecessary, were not adequately tested, and distorted true business results. The defendant KPMG partners, who worked near Xerox headquarters in Stamford, Conn., or at KPMG's New York headquarters, gave little weight to these warnings from on-the-scene KPMG affiliates and did not demand that Xerox justify the reasons for departures from historic accounting methods or establish the accuracy of the new, manipulative practices. Although the defendants occasionally voiced concern to Xerox management about the ""topside accounting devices"" developed and manipulated by senior corporate financial managers to increase revenue and earnings, the defendants did little or nothing when Xerox ignored their concerns and continued manipulating its financial results. The defendants then knowingly or recklessly set aside their reservations, failed in their professional duties as auditors, and gave a clean bill of health to Xerox's financial statements. Rather than put at risk a lucrative financial relationship with a premier client, the defendants failed to challenge Xerox's improper accounting actions and make the company accurately report its financial results. As noted in the complaint: ""There was no watchdog at Xerox. KPMG's bark sounded no warning to investors; its bite was toothless."" After this fraudulent conduct was investigated and exposed, Xerox, employing a new auditor, issued a $6.1 billion restatement of its equipment revenues and a $1.9 billion restatement of its pre-tax earnings for the years 1997 through 2000. The Commission's fraud allegations against KPMG and its partners address accounting errors that inflated equipment revenues by $3 billion and inflated pre-tax earning by $1.2 billion for the years 1997 through 2000. The Complaint alleges that each defendant violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 12b-20. On April 11, 2002, the Commission brought an injunctive action against Xerox based on the same allegations of accounting fraud as are alleged against the KPMG defendants, as well as other allegations. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws. Xerox also paid a $10 million civil penalty, agreed to restate its financial statements and agreed to hire a consultant to review the company's internal accounting controls and policies. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Xerox Corporation, Civil Action No. 02-CV-2780 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y.) (April 11, 2002). See Litigation Release No. 17465 / April 11, 2002/Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1542 / April 11, 2002. The SEC is continuing its investigation of this matter. The SEC's complaint can be found on the SEC's web site: For further information contact:Stephen M. Cutler, Director of Enforcement -- (202) 942-4500Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of Enforcement -- (202) 942-4560 Ã The Commission's complaint further alleges: Beginning at least as early as 1997, Xerox initiated or increased reliance on various accounting devices to manipulate its equipment revenues and earnings. Most of these ""topside accounting devices"" violated GAAP and most improperly increased the amount of equipment revenue from leased office equipment products which Xerox recognized in its quarterly and annual financial statements filed with the Commission and distributed to investors and the public. This improper revenue recognition had the effect of inflating equipment revenues and earnings beyond what actual operating results warranted. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently permitted Xerox to manipulate reserves to boost the company's earnings. Under GAAP, when lessors such as Xerox enter into a ""sales type lease"" they must recognize immediately nearly all of the revenue attributed to the value of the product, but must spread recognition of financing, servicing and supply revenues over the life of the lease. Traditionally, Xerox local offices in each country booked the value of leased products at the time a lease was entered into, accounting also for the cost of financing and servicing the equipment during the lease period, based on local market conditions. Beginning in at least 1997, Xerox altered its accounting to treat more finance and servicing revenue as part of the value of the equipment, allowing Xerox to recognize a greater portion of revenue from new leases immediately in its financial statements. These calculations were made either by management at Stamford or by local country managers based on explicit assumptions dictated by Stamford, which ignored local economic conditions. In the complaint, the Commission referred to these new methods as ""topside accounting devices"" imposed by senior Xerox financial managers. Xerox told KPMG it needed to resort to these improper accounting devices because it could no longer rely on the traditional way it established the fair value of its products. Although adoption of these new methods made Xerox revenue and earnings reports not comparable to earlier periods, and resulted in less revenue and earnings for reporting in future periods, Xerox never informed the public of the changes. When Xerox imposed these new accounting methods on offices in Europe, Canada, Brazil and Japan, KPMG auditors in those countries recognized that the changes were both unnecessary and unrealistic. In 1997, KPMG's Canadian affiliate warned Dolanski that Xerox's new method for moving revenue from financing to equipment was ""not supportable"" and posed an ""unnecessary control risk with regard to accounting records."" KPMG's Brazil office told Safran the following year that the finance assumptions generated by Xerox's new accounting were significantly below prevailing interest rates and that they ""did not consider all of the uncertainties inherent in [Xerox Brazil's] business and, consequently, on its cash flow."" Similarly, KPMG's affiliate in Tokyo in 1999 objected to the use of the new interest rate formula by Fuji Xerox because it did ""not match the actual status"" of Fuji's business and no procedures had been performed to determine if it might. KPMG's affiliate in the United Kingdom voiced numerous concerns to the defendant partners over the years about the new methods of lease accounting imposed by Xerox senior management in Connecticut on European offices. The UK auditors repeatedly informed the defendant partners that there was no objective basis for the new accounting devices, that they carried a ""high risk of significant misstatement"" and were ""potentially arbitrary"". In 2000, KPMG in the UK told defendant Conway that Xerox's accounting changes to reduce service revenues and increase equipment revenues ""are not considered to produce results which reflect commercial reality."" The KPMG defendants sometimes ""expressed muted doubts about topside accounting practices"" to Xerox management. Defendant Safran, for example, told management at the conclusion of the 1998 audit that accounting adjustments should be entered at the transaction level, rather than at the ""top level,"" so that they could ""be effectively monitored and prudently controlled."" When nothing was done, Safran told the Xerox Audit Committee a year later with respect to topside accounting adjustments that ""we believe the Company needs to improve its analytic processes and controls to confirm that the assumptions used are reasonable and that appropriate fair values are derived from existing methodologies."" Safran consulted on these issues with Conway, the national practice partner, and Boyle, the relationship partner assigned to represent KPMG before the Xerox Board of Directors and its Audit Committee. Xerox did nothing to address or correct KPMG's concerns, however, and KPMG did not press more vigorously for action or threaten to qualify its audit report. The fraudulent practices continued and were not disclosed to the investing public. Indeed, in 1999, Safran contacted Conway and advised him about his heightened concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting at Xerox. As the complaint states: Ultimately, Xerox requested that KPMG remove Safran from the audit and KPMG complied. Six months after the Commission's investigation commenced into Xerox's accounting and had begun examining KPMG personnel under oath, KPMG requested that Xerox's Audit Committee investigate Xerox's accounting devices. However, KPMG did not perform any audit procedures itself to determine whether Xerox's accounting produced results that conformed to economic reality. ""Instead,"" as the complaint states, ""[KPMG] cited concurring reviews of consultants hired by Xerox who admitted they did not apply professional audit or attestation standards in their studies."" Although Xerox did restate earnings by approximately $276 million that resulted from some of its topside accounting devices, KPMG knowingly or recklessly continued to allow Xerox's improper use of many such devices in Xerox's fiscal 2000 financial statements. KPMG's failure to require a full restatement ultimately resulted in Xerox's $6.1 billion restatement.",-0.32727272727272727,Negative
77,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against eight current and former officers and employees of Qwest Communications International Inc., alleging that they inflated the company's revenues by approximately $144 million in 2000 and 2001 in order to meet earnings projections and revenue expectations. The Commission's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, seeks anti-fraud injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries, bonuses, stock and other compensation) and, as to certain defendants, permanent bars from service as an officer or a director of a public company. The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants artificially accelerated Qwest's recognition of revenue in two equipment sale transactions for its Global Business Markets unit. When Qwest and Global Business determined that Qwest was falling short of its quarterly revenue targets and would not achieve the projected growth for the quarters ending June 30, 2001, and Sept. 30, 2000, the defendants bridged the revenue gap by fraudulently mischaracterizing these transactions.

78,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against eight current and former officers and employees of Qwest Communications International Inc., alleging that they inflated the company's revenues by approximately $144 million in 2000 and 2001 in order to meet earnings projections and revenue expectations. The Commission's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, seeks anti-fraud injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries, bonuses, stock and other compensation) and, as to certain defendants, permanent bars from service as an officer or a director of a public company. The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants artificially accelerated Qwest's recognition of revenue in two equipment sale transactions for its Global Business Markets unit. When Qwest and Global Business determined that Qwest was falling short of its quarterly revenue targets and would not achieve the projected growth for the quarters ending June 30, 2001, and Sept. 30, 2000, the defendants bridged the revenue gap by fraudulently mischaracterizing these transactions.

79,"\- Securities regulators issued a report today showing that nearly one in three transactions in front-end load mutual funds that appeared eligible for a breakpoint discount did not receive one, based on the results of a three-month examination sweep of selected broker-dealers. The report, issued jointly by the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange, revealed the average discount not provided was $364 per transaction. As a result of those findings, approximately 2,000 broker-dealers are being required to review samples of their front-end load mutual fund purchase transactions and report the results to NASD. From November 2002 through January 2003, SEC, NASD and NYSE examiners reviewed thousands of mutual fund transactions by 43 broker-dealers that sell front-end load funds. Examiners found significant failures to deliver ""breakpoint"" sales load discounts to eligible customers among the transactions reviewed. Typically, breakpoint discounts are applied to front-end load funds to reduce sales loads at the investment levels of $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million. Industry figures show that less than seven percent of all mutual fund sales in 2002 were of front-end load funds. The limited nature of the examination sweep does not allow regulators to determine the full extent of the breakpoint issue industry-wide. Accordingly, NASD is requiring broker-dealers selling front-end load mutual funds to assess their own compliance using a specified sampling methodology, developed in conjunction with the SEC. That methodology will be forwarded to broker dealers shortly. In addition, examiners are following up with the firms already examined to determine whether deficiencies are being corrected and that excessive sales load charges are being refunded to customers. Major examination findings include: NASD is leading an industry task force to explore and recommend ways that the mutual fund and broker-dealer industries can prevent breakpoint problems and eliminate errors in sales load calculations in the future. Specifically, the group's participants - NASD, the NYSE, the Investment Company Institute, the Securities Industry Association and industry leaders - are tasked with finding possible universal order processing solutions. Both the SEC and NASD have alerted investors to the breakpoint issue and placed additional information on their Web sites. Investors can learn more about reduced front-end sales loads by going to www.sec.gov/answers/breakpt.htm and www.nasdr.com/alert_breakpoint.htm. Investors can access fund expense calculators at www.sec.gov/investor/tools/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm and www.nasdr.com/fundcalc/expense_analyzers.asp. Investors who believe they have not received breakpoint discounts to which they were entitled should first contact their brokers and ask that the discount be applied.

82,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and four of its former senior executives with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.'s securities fraud. The Commission's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleges that Merrill Lynch and its former executives aided and abetted Enron Corp.'s earnings manipulation by engaging in two fraudulent year-end transactions in 1999. The transactions had the purpose and effect of overstating Enron's reported financial results. Specifically, Enron used these transactions to add approximately $60 million to its fourth quarter of 1999 income (improving net income from $199 million to $259 million or 33 percent) and to increase its full year 1999 earnings per share from $1.09 to $1.17. Simultaneous with the filing of this action, the Commission has agreed to accept Merrill Lynch's offer to settle this matter. Merrill Lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has agreed to pay $80 million dollars in disgorgement, penalties and interest and has agreed to the entry of a permanent anti-fraud injunction prohibiting future violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud. The four former Merrill Lynch executives named in the complaint, Robert S. Furst, Schuyler M. Tilney, Daniel H. Bayly and Thomas W. Davis, are contesting the matter. SEC Chairman William H. Donaldson said, ""This action is a message to all who would help a reporting company commit fraud: we will bring the full weight of our enforcement arsenal against you. Our commitment to protect investors demands nothing less."" Added Enforcement Director Stephen M. Cutler, ""Even if you don't have direct responsibility for a company's financial statements, you cannot turn a blind eye when you have reason to know that what you are doing will help make those statements false and misleading. At the end of 1999, Merrill Lynch and the executives we are suing today did exactly that: They helped Enron defraud its investors through two deals that were created with one purpose in mind -- to make Enron's financial statements look better than they actually were."" As alleged in the Commission's complaint, the first transaction was an asset-parking arrangement whereby on Dec. 29, 1999, Merrill Lynch bought an interest in certain Nigerian barges from Enron with an express understanding that Enron would arrange for the sale of this interest by Merrill Lynch within six months at a specified rate of return. In substance, this transaction was, at best, a bridge loan because the risks and rewards of ownership of the interest in the barges did not pass to Merrill Lynch. As further alleged in the complaint, Merrill Lynch and the named executives knew that Enron would record $28 million in revenue and $12 million in pre-tax income in connection with this transaction. The Commission alleges that Merrill Lynch and the named executives entered into this transaction solely to accommodate Enron, despite express concerns that Merrill Lynch could appear to be aiding and abetting Enron's earnings manipulation. In 2000, Enron arranged to take Merrill Lynch out of the barge deal on the agreed time frame at the agreed rate of return. In the second transaction, also closed in the last days of December 1999, Merrill Lynch and Enron entered into two energy options Ã¢ÂÂ one physical and one financial Ã¢ÂÂ that Merrill Lynch knew had the purpose and effect of inflating Enron's income by approximately $50 million. The complaint details that, at year-end 1999, the trading under these options was not scheduled to begin for approximately nine months. Before the transaction was closed, the complaint alleges, Enron told Merrill Lynch that, despite a nominal term of four years, it might want to unwind this transaction early. Merrill Lynch believed that the two trades were essentially a wash and knew that the transaction would have a significant impact on Enron's reported results, bonuses, and stock price. Merrill Lynch demanded a multi-million dollar fee for entering into this transaction; Enron ultimately agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a structured fee to be paid over four years with a net present value of $17 million. In 2000, Enron approached Merrill Lynch seeking to unwind the transaction before trading under the energy options was scheduled to begin. The deal was unwound in June 2000 after Merrill Lynch agreed to reduce its fee to $8.5 million to terminate the transaction. The complaint alleges that Merrill Lynch and the named executives aided and abetted Enron's violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. For these violations, the Commission seeks in its complaint a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties with respect to Merrill Lynch and, with respect to the individual defendants, permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and permanent officer and director bars. Merrill Lynch offered, and the Commission has agreed, to settle the Commission's charges against the company. Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Merrill Lynch filed a consent and final judgment settling the Commission's action against it. In the consent, Merrill Lynch has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws in the future. Merrill Lynch also has agreed to pay disgorgement, penalties and interest in the amount of $80 million. Specifically, Merrill Lynch will pay $37.5 million in disgorgement, $5 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $37.5 million. As noted above, the Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud. In agreeing to resolve this matter on the terms described above, the Commission took into account certain affirmative conduct by Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch terminated Davis and Tilney after they refused to testify before the staff and instead asserted their Fifth Amendment rights. In addition, Merrill Lynch brought the energy trade transaction to the staff's attention at a time when it believed the staff was unaware of its existence. The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this investigation. The Commission also acknowledges the continuing coordination among the Division of Enforcement, the Justice Department Enron Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Enron investigation. The Commission's investigation into Enron is ongoing. For further information contact:",-0.1282051282051282,Negative

The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Birmingham, Ala., alleges that since 1999, at the insistence of Scrushy, HealthSouth systematically overstated its earnings by at least $1.4 billion in order to meet or exceed Wall Street earnings expectations. The false increases in earnings were matched by false increases in HealthSouth's assets. By the third quarter of 2002, HealthSouth's assets were overstated by at least $800 million, or approximately 10 percent.

The complaint further alleges that, following the Commission's order last year requiring executive officers of major public companies to certify the accuracy and completeness of their companies' financial statements, Scrushy certified HealthSouth's financial statements when he knew or was reckless in not knowing they were materially false and misleading. ""HealthSouth's fraud represents an appalling betrayal of investors,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""HealthSouth's standard operating procedure was to manipulate the company's earnings to create the false impression that the company was meeting Wall Street's expectations."" Richard P.

Scrushy with a massive accounting fraud.

The false increases in earnings were matched by false increases in HealthSouth's assets. By the third quarter of 2002, HealthSouth's assets were overstated by at least $800 million, or approximately 10 percent.

Donaldson, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, North American Securities Administrators Association President Christine Bruenn, NASD Chairman and CEO Robert Glauber, New York Stock Exchange Chairman and CEO Dick Grasso, and state securities regulators announced today that enforcement actions against ten of the nation's top investment firms have been completed, thereby finalizing the global settlement in principle reached and announced by regulators last December. That settlement followed joint investigations by the regulators of allegations of undue influence of investment banking interests on securities research at brokerage firms, and the enforcement actions announced today track the provisions of the December global settlement in principle. The ten firms against which enforcement actions are being announced today are: Pursuant to the enforcement actions, the ten firms will pay a total of $875 million in penalties and disgorgement, consisting of $387.5 million in disgorgement and $487.5 million in penalties (which includes Merrill Lynch's previous payment of $100 million in connection with its prior settlement with the states relating to research analyst conflicts of interest). Under the settlement agreements, half of the $775 million payment by the firms other than Merrill Lynch will be paid in resolution of actions brought by the SEC, NYSE and NASD, and will be put into a fund to benefit customers of the firms. The remainder of the funds will be paid to the states. In addition, the firms will make payments totaling $432.5 million to fund independent research, and payments of $80 million from seven of the firms will fund and promote investor education. The total of all payments is roughly $1.4 billion. Under the terms of the settlement, the firms will not seek reimbursement or indemnification for any penalties that they pay. In addition, the firms will not seek a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any federal, state or local tax for any penalty amounts that they pay under the settlement. Attached is a list of how much each firm is paying pursuant to the settlement. The individual penalties include some of the highest ever imposed in civil enforcement actions under the securities laws. In addition to the monetary payments, the firms are also required to comply with significant requirements that dramatically reform their future practices, including separating the research and investment banking departments at the firms, how research is reviewed and supervised, and making independent research available to investors. The changes that the firms will be required to make are discussed below. The enforcement actions allege that, from approximately mid-1999 through mid-2001 or later, all of the firms engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts, thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner. In addition, the regulators found supervisory deficiencies at every firm. The enforcement actions, the allegations of which were neither admitted nor denied by the firms, also included additional charges: Under the terms of the settlement, an injunction will be entered against each of the firms, enjoining it from violating the statutes and rules that it is alleged to have violated. Today's enforcement actions will also reform industry practices regarding the relationship between investment banking and research and will bolster the integrity of equity research. Among other significant reforms included in these actions are the following: Further, seven of the firms will collectively pay $80 million for investor education. The SEC, NYSE and NASD have authorized that $52.5 million of these funds be put into an Investor Education Fund that will develop and support programs designed to equip investors with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions. The remaining $27.5 million will be paid to state securities regulators and will be used by them for investor education purposes. In addition to the other restrictions and requirements imposed by the enforcement actions, the ten firms have collectively entered into a voluntary agreement restricting allocations of securities in hot IPOs â?? offerings that begin trading in the aftermarket at a premium â?? to certain company executive officers and directors, a practice known as ""spinning."" This will promote fairness in the allocation of IPO shares and prevent firms from using these shares to attract investment banking business. Remarking on the historic settlement, SEC Chairman Donaldson said, ""The hallmark of our business and financial system is that the rule of law must prevail and when wrongdoing occurs, it must be confronted and punished. Today we do just that."" Mr. Donaldson went on to say that, ""These cases reflect a sad chapter in the history of American business â?? a chapter in which those who reaped enormous benefits from the trust of investors profoundly betrayed that trust. These cases also represent an important new chapter in our ongoing efforts to restore investors' faith in the fairness and integrity of our markets."" New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said, ""This global settlement is one of the largest effected by securities regulators to date. It fulfills our promise to help restore integrity to the marketplace and investor confidence in our system. The wide-ranging structural reforms to firms' research operations will empower investors to use securities research in a practical and meaningful way when making investment decisions."" ""This case was a model for state-federal regulatory cooperation to benefit investors. As they did with microcap fraud and day trading, the states helped to spotlight a problem and worked with national regulators on enforcement actions and market-wide rule changes,"" said NASAA President, Christine Bruenn. ""We're hopeful that the settlement announced today will help restore the faith and trust of wary and cynical investors."" Ms. Bruenn added that, ""If the Street follows both the spirit and the letter of this settlement, it will change the way business is done on Wall Street. Investors â?? not investment banking fees â?? will come first. And analysts will be beholden to the truth, not the IPO business."" NASD Chairman and CEO Robert Glauber said, ""Today marks an ending, but even more, a beginning. Because in finalizing this settlement, we take a giant step on the road to restoring and renewing investor confidence. The final resolution we announce today is a good one for everyone, everywhere, who has a stake in the integrity of the U.S. capital markets."" ""This historic settlement establishes a clear bright line -- a banker is a banker and an analyst is an analyst. The two shall never cross,"" said NYSE Chairman and CEO Dick Grasso. ""The partnership between the SEC, state regulators, the SROs and our lawmakers remains the best and most effective system of market regulation and the global settlement reflects that. Our capital markets model is the most successful in the world and I am absolutely certain that we will come out of this period with a stronger system that puts the interests of the investing public first."" To implement this global settlement, the SEC today filed separate actions against each of the firms in Federal District Court in New York City and, concurrently, the NYSE and NASD completed disciplinary proceedings pursuant to the disciplinary procedures of their respective organizations. At the state level, model settlement agreements have been finalized and the NASAA Board of Directors has recommended that all states accept the terms of the agreements. The proposed Final Judgments in the SEC actions are subject to Court approval. *Payment made in prior settlement of research analyst conflicts of interest with the states securities regulators.

The SEC, NYSE and NASD have authorized that $52.5 million of these funds be put into an Investor Education Fund that will develop and support programs designed to equip investors with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions. The remaining $27.5 million will be paid to state securities regulators and will be used by them for investor education purposes. In addition to the other restrictions and requirements imposed by the enforcement actions, the ten firms have collectively entered into a voluntary agreement restricting allocations of securities in hot IPOs â?? offerings that begin trading in the aftermarket at a premium â?? to certain company executive officers and directors, a practice known as ""spinning."" This will promote fairness in the allocation of IPO shares and prevent firms from using these shares to attract investment banking business. Remarking on the historic settlement, SEC Chairman Donaldson said, ""The hallmark of our business and financial system is that the rule of law must prevail and when wrongdoing occurs, it must be confronted and punished. Today we do just that."" Mr. Donaldson went on to say that, ""These cases reflect a sad chapter in the history of American business â?? a chapter in which those who reaped enormous benefits from the trust of investors profoundly betrayed that trust. These cases also represent an important new chapter in our ongoing efforts to restore investors' faith in the fairness and integrity of our markets."" New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said, ""This global settlement is one of the largest effected by securities regulators to date. It fulfills our promise to help restore integrity to the marketplace and investor confidence in our system. The wide-ranging structural reforms to firms' research operations will empower investors to use securities research in a practical and meaningful way when making investment decisions."" ""This case was a model for state-federal regulatory cooperation to benefit investors. As they did with microcap fraud and day trading, the states helped to spotlight a problem and worked with national regulators on enforcement actions and market-wide rule changes,"" said NASAA President, Christine Bruenn. ""We're hopeful that the settlement announced today will help restore the faith and trust of wary and cynical investors."" Ms. Bruenn added that, ""If the Street follows both the spirit and the letter of this settlement, it will change the way business is done on Wall Street. Investors â?? not investment banking fees â?? will come first. And analysts will be beholden to the truth, not the IPO business."" NASD Chairman and CEO Robert Glauber said, ""Today marks an ending, but even more, a beginning. Because in finalizing this settlement, we take a giant step on the road to restoring and renewing investor confidence. The final resolution we announce today is a good one for everyone, everywhere, who has a stake in the integrity of the U.S. capital markets."" ""This historic settlement establishes a clear bright line -- a banker is a banker and an analyst is an analyst. The two shall never cross,"" said NYSE Chairman and CEO Dick Grasso. ""The partnership between the SEC, state regulators, the SROs and our lawmakers remains the best and most effective system of market regulation and the global settlement reflects that. Our capital markets model is the most successful in the world and I am absolutely certain that we will come out of this period with a stronger system that puts the interests of the investing public first."" To implement this global settlement, the SEC today filed separate actions against each of the firms in Federal District Court in New York City and, concurrently, the NYSE and NASD completed disciplinary proceedings pursuant to the disciplinary procedures of their respective organizations.

Donaldson, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, North American Securities Administrators Association President Christine Bruenn, NASD Chairman and CEO Robert Glauber, New York Stock Exchange Chairman and CEO Dick Grasso, and state securities regulators announced today that enforcement actions against ten of the nation's top investment firms have been completed, thereby finalizing the global settlement in principle reached and announced by regulators last December. That settlement followed joint investigations by the regulators of allegations of undue influence of investment banking interests on securities research at brokerage firms, and the enforcement actions announced today track the provisions of the December global settlement in principle. The ten firms against which enforcement actions are being announced today are: Pursuant to the enforcement actions, the ten firms will pay a total of $875 million in penalties and disgorgement, consisting of $387.5 million in disgorgement and $487.5 million in penalties (which includes Merrill Lynch's previous payment of $100 million in connection with its prior settlement with the states relating to research analyst conflicts of interest). Under the settlement agreements, half of the $775 million payment by the firms other than Merrill Lynch will be paid in resolution of actions brought by the SEC, NYSE and NASD, and will be put into a fund to benefit customers of the firms. The remainder of the funds will be paid to the states. In addition, the firms will make payments totaling $432.5 million to fund independent research, and payments of $80 million from seven of the firms will fund and promote investor education. The total of all payments is roughly $1.4 billion. Under the terms of the settlement, the firms will not seek reimbursement or indemnification for any penalties that they pay. In addition, the firms will not seek a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any federal, state or local tax for any penalty amounts that they pay under the settlement. Attached is a list of how much each firm is paying pursuant to the settlement. The individual penalties include some of the highest ever imposed in civil enforcement actions under the securities laws. In addition to the monetary payments, the firms are also required to comply with significant requirements that dramatically reform their future practices, including separating the research and investment banking departments at the firms, how research is reviewed and supervised, and making independent research available to investors. The changes that the firms will be required to make are discussed below. The enforcement actions allege that, from approximately mid-1999 through mid-2001 or later, all of the firms engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts, thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner. In addition, the regulators found supervisory deficiencies at every firm. The enforcement actions, the allegations of which were neither admitted nor denied by the firms, also included additional charges: Under the terms of the settlement, an injunction will be entered against each of the firms, enjoining it from violating the statutes and rules that it is alleged to have violated.

The regulators charged that, among other things, Blodget, of New York City, issued fraudulent research under Merrill Lynch's name, as well as research in which he expressed views that were inconsistent with privately expressed negative views.

108,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an Amended Complaint charging five additional former executives of Enron Broadband Services, Inc. (EBS) - a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. - with violating the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws and personally reaping more than $150 million in unlawful profits. Among other things, the Amended Complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, seeks disgorgement of those ill-gotten gains as well as civil money penalties from the five defendants: Kenneth D. Rice, former CEO; Joseph Hirko, former CEO; Kevin P. Hannon, former COO; Rex T. Shelby, former Vice President, and F. Scott Yeager, former Vice President. In addition, the SEC is seeking an order providing that any civil penalties will be added to other monies recovered, which will then be distributed to the victims of the alleged violations. Today's action amends the March 12 Complaint filed against former EBS executives Kevin A. Howard and Michael W. Krautz. ""The actions described in the Amended Complaint illustrate the lengths to which some at Enron would go to create the illusion of stellar financial performance,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. "" It is especially reprehensible that these defendants opted for their own financial well-being at the expense of Enron's shareholders."" ""At a point when Enron's touted groundbreaking broadband technology was little more than a concept - and its business model was not commercially viable - these defendants played important roles in perpetuating the fairy tale that Enron was capable of spinning straw - or more appropriately, fiber - into gold,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement. The filing of the Amended Complaint ""is yet another step in unraveling the various strands of fraudulent conduct that perpetuated the Enron myth,"" Thomsen said. ""Any number of people and entities contributed to Enron's ultimate collapse, and as today's action as well as our previous actions makes clear - we are determined to pursue them, and hold them accountable under law."" The Amended Complaint alleges that Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager engaged in a wide-ranging fraudulent scheme to, among other things, inflate the value of Enron stock through a series of false and misleading statements and the omission of material information in such public statements about the technology, financial condition, performance and value of EBS. The false and misleading statements took the form of press releases over a two-year period as well as presentations and statements made at Enron's annual analyst conference in January 2000 and 2001. The false statements sought to distinguish the capabilities of the Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), Enron's broadband network, from other networks by claiming that it contained built-in intelligence - a software control layer called the ""Broadband Operating System"" (BOS) - that allowed it to perform more sophisticated applications than other networks. The BOS and its predecessor, InterAgent, however, did not work as Enron claimed and the EIN was unable to perform the applications that were represented it could perform. In addition, Rice and Hannon made false statements and material omissions concerning the value of Enron's broadband business and its commercial success at the January 2001 analyst conference. As a result of the false statements, Enron's stock was artificially inflated. Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager then sold large amounts of Enron stock at the inflated levels, at a time when they knew that the statements were false and misleading and when they were in possession of material non-public information concerning the true status of the technology and EBS's commercial success. The unlawful profits were substantial: Hirko -- $53.0 million; Rice -- $40.3 million; Yeager -- $35.1 million; Shelby -- $17.5 million; and Hannon -- $9.0 million. The Amended Complaint charges Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as an officer or director of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. This action amends the Complaint filed against Kevin A. Howard and Michael W. Krautz, two former EBS executives, on March 12, 2003. That Complaint as well as the Amended Complaint alleges that Howard and Krautz engaged in a sham transaction, known as ""Project Braveheart,"" which caused Enron to overstate its reported net income for the year 2000 by $53 million and for first quarter 2001 by $58 million. The Amended Complaint alleges that the fictitious net income generated through Project Braveheart was an integral part of a broader fraudulent scheme to deceive the public about EBS. The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, which today filed related criminal charges against Rice, Hirko, Hannon, Shelby and Yeager. The Commission's investigation is continuing.",-0.52,Negative
109,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic. The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Stewart committed illegal insider trading when she sold stock in a biopharmaceutical company, ImClone Systems, Inc., on Dec. 27, 2001, after receiving an unlawful tip from Bacanovic, at the time a broker with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. The Commission further alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic subsequently created an alibi for Stewart's ImClone sales and concealed important facts during SEC and criminal investigations into her trades. In a separate action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has obtained an indictment charging Stewart and Bacanovic criminally for their false statements concerning Stewart's ImClone trades. The Commission seeks, among other relief, an order requiring Stewart and Bacanovic to disgorge the losses Stewart avoided through her unlawful trades, plus civil monetary penalties. The Commission also seeks an order barring Stewart from acting as a director of, and limiting her activities as an officer of, any public company. Stewart has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, said: ""It is fundamentally unfair for someone to have an edge on the market just because she has a stockbroker who is willing to break the rules and give her an illegal tip. It's worse still when the individual engaging in the insider trading is the Chairman and CEO of a public company."" Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""The Commission simply cannot allow corporate executives or industry professionals to profit illegally from their access to nonpublic information. The coordinated action announced today by the U.S. Attorney's Office shows that the consequences for those individuals will be even greater if we uncover evidence that they obstructed our investigation."" Stewart's Dec. 27, 2001, ImClone sales came as ImClone and the market anxiously awaited an imminent decision from the Food and Drug Administration on one of ImClone's key products, a cancer treatment called ""Erbitux."" Bacanovic's unlawful inside tip was that other Bacanovic clients Ã¢ÂÂ ImClone's CEO, Samuel Waksal, and Waksal's daughter Ã¢ÂÂ had just placed orders to sell all the ImClone stock they held at Merrill Lynch. At the time, Waksal secretly knew that the FDA was about to reject ImClone's Erbitux application. Information about the Waksals' efforts to sell was confidential under Merrill Lynch policies, which prohibited employees from disclosing client transactions or effecting client trades on the basis of other client transactions. Had information about the Waksals' efforts to sell been known publicly, it would have signaled insider pessimism at ImClone about the FDA decision, the prospects for Erbitux, and the future of the company, according to the complaint. The Commission alleges that, during the morning of Dec. 27, 2001, Bacanovic instructed his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, to tell Stewart that Waksal and his daughter were selling all the ImClone stock held in their Merrill Lynch accounts. During a subsequent telephone call, Faneuil conveyed that information to Stewart, who promptly instructed Faneuil to sell all 3,928 shares of her ImClone stock. The next day, Dec. 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA had decided not to accept ImClone's Erbitux application for filing. By the close of the next trading day, Monday, Dec. 31, 2001, the price of ImClone stock dropped 16% to $46 per share. By selling when she did, Stewart avoided losses of $45,673. The Commission alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic went on to lie when the Commission staff and criminal authorities questioned them about the facts surrounding Stewart's sale of ImClone stock. Stewart and Bacanovic fabricated an alibi for Stewart's trades, stating that she sold her ImClone stock because she and Bacanovic had decided earlier that she would sell if ImClone's stock price fell below $60 per share. In addition, Stewart told the government that she did not recall anyone telling her that day that any of the Waksals were selling their ImClone stock. Pursuant to a separate Commission order issued this morning, the Commission has barred Faneuil from association with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter.

113,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic. The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Stewart committed illegal insider trading when she sold stock in a biopharmaceutical company, ImClone Systems, Inc., on Dec. 27, 2001, after receiving an unlawful tip from Bacanovic, at the time a broker with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. The Commission further alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic subsequently created an alibi for Stewart's ImClone sales and concealed important facts during SEC and criminal investigations into her trades. In a separate action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has obtained an indictment charging Stewart and Bacanovic criminally for their false statements concerning Stewart's ImClone trades. The Commission seeks, among other relief, an order requiring Stewart and Bacanovic to disgorge the losses Stewart avoided through her unlawful trades, plus civil monetary penalties. The Commission also seeks an order barring Stewart from acting as a director of, and limiting her activities as an officer of, any public company. Stewart has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, said: ""It is fundamentally unfair for someone to have an edge on the market just because she has a stockbroker who is willing to break the rules and give her an illegal tip. It's worse still when the individual engaging in the insider trading is the Chairman and CEO of a public company."" Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""The Commission simply cannot allow corporate executives or industry professionals to profit illegally from their access to nonpublic information. The coordinated action announced today by the U.S. Attorney's Office shows that the consequences for those individuals will be even greater if we uncover evidence that they obstructed our investigation."" Stewart's Dec. 27, 2001, ImClone sales came as ImClone and the market anxiously awaited an imminent decision from the Food and Drug Administration on one of ImClone's key products, a cancer treatment called ""Erbitux."" Bacanovic's unlawful inside tip was that other Bacanovic clients Ã¢ÂÂ ImClone's CEO, Samuel Waksal, and Waksal's daughter Ã¢ÂÂ had just placed orders to sell all the ImClone stock they held at Merrill Lynch. At the time, Waksal secretly knew that the FDA was about to reject ImClone's Erbitux application. Information about the Waksals' efforts to sell was confidential under Merrill Lynch policies, which prohibited employees from disclosing client transactions or effecting client trades on the basis of other client transactions. Had information about the Waksals' efforts to sell been known publicly, it would have signaled insider pessimism at ImClone about the FDA decision, the prospects for Erbitux, and the future of the company, according to the complaint. The Commission alleges that, during the morning of Dec. 27, 2001, Bacanovic instructed his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, to tell Stewart that Waksal and his daughter were selling all the ImClone stock held in their Merrill Lynch accounts. During a subsequent telephone call, Faneuil conveyed that information to Stewart, who promptly instructed Faneuil to sell all 3,928 shares of her ImClone stock. The next day, Dec. 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA had decided not to accept ImClone's Erbitux application for filing.

115,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against three former employees of Dynegy Inc. in connection with their roles in Dynegy's Project Alpha, a $300 million financing transaction that disguised the company's true financial condition. In a civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Houston, the Commission is seeking fines and disgorgement of all of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, including bonuses and trading profits received during the period of their misconduct. The Commission alleges that the three defendants disregarded accounting advice from Dynegy's outside auditors, established secret side agreements to conceal their improper conduct, authorized the improper elimination of risk by equity investors in a special-purpose entity and concealed transaction details from the company, the company's auditors and the investing public. Project Alpha was previously the subject of a settled cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission on Sept. 24, 2002. In its order, the Commission found that Dynegy violated the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws by improperly recording Alpha's impact on Dynegy's financial statements as $300 million in operating cash flow and $79 million in net income (from a presumed tax benefit), when instead, the $300 million was actually a loan and the tax benefit was invalid. In settling the Commission's action, Dynegy paid a $3 million civil penalty. ""The investing public has a right to expect accuracy and honesty in corporate transactions. These individuals were in a position to insure both and they failed to do so,"" said Harold F. Degenhardt, District Administrator of the Commission's Fort Worth Office. ""The actions taken today by both the Commission and the Department of Justice are but another step in the process of restoring investor confidence--those who betray the public trust will be pursued and punished. Investors deserve this commitment and the markets require it."" Degenhardt added, ""The Commission's investigation into the role that others may have played in this matter is continuing and further action is likely."" The individuals named in the Commission's suit are: In its complaint against Foster, Olis and Sharkey, the Commission alleges as follows. In its complaint, the Commission seeks an order against all the defendants, enjoining them from violations, and from aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, imposing civil money penalties, and ordering disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including bonuses and trading profits received during the period of their misconduct. Foster, Olis and Sharkey are no longer employed by Dynegy. In 2001, Foster received a salary of $170,000 and a bonus of $160,000, while Olis received a salary of $162,000, a bonus of $110,000, a grant of options for 25,000 shares, and further profited from the sale of his personally held Dynegy stock in the approximate amount of $200,000. Sharkey received a salary of $80,000 in 2001. The Commission filed its action at the same time that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas unsealed indictments against Foster, Olis and Sharkey for the conduct that is the subject of the Commission's complaint.

116,"ÂÂ The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed documents modifying the proposed settlement of its claim for a civil penalty in its civil action against WorldCom Inc. in federal district court in the Southern District of New York. The filings supplement the relief provisions in the proposed settlement previously filed in that action on May 19, 2003, which required WorldCom to pay a civil penalty judgment in the amount of $1,510,000,000. That proposed settlement further provided that, as a result of the company's pending bankruptcy case, the Commission's judgment would be satisfied by WorldCom's payment, after review and approval of the terms of the settlement by the Bankruptcy Court, of $500,000,000. (Litigation Release No. 18147). Following the parties' agreement on the terms of the proposed settlement, and after an initial hearing before the District Court and in light of issues raised by the District Court Judge, WorldCom and the SEC mutually agreed to supplement to the terms of the proposed settlement. The modifications to the proposed settlement filed today Ã¢ÂÂ to which the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of WorldCom have consented Ã¢ÂÂ provide that in the event of confirmation of a plan of reorganization of WorldCom by the Bankruptcy Court, WorldCom's obligations under the Commission's judgment shall be deemed to be satisfied by the company's payment of $500,000,000 in cash and by its transfer of common stock in the reorganized company having a value of $250,000,000 to a distribution agent to be appointed by the District Court. The supplemental relief, if approved, would allow victims of the fraud to share in the potential upside of owning WorldCom common stock when it emerges from bankruptcy. All other material terms of the proposed settlement remain the same. The proposed settlement is subject to review and approval of the District Court hearing the Commission's action against WorldCom and the Bankruptcy Court handling WorldCom's bankruptcy case (which is also in the Southern District of New York). Oxley Act of 2002. The Commission has alleged that WorldCom misled investors by overstating its income from at least as early as 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting. (Litigation Release No. 17829.) all quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. (Litigation Release No. 17588). The Commission also sought the appointment of a corporate monitor for WorldCom, and on July 3, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position. On November 26, 2002, the Commission obtained a judgment against WorldCom through which the Commission obtained the full injunctive relief it sought against WorldCom. In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required the WorldCom to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws. The November 26, 2002 judgment explicitly left open the determination of monetary penalties to be imposed on WorldCom. (Litigation Release No. 17866). Since the Commission filed its action against WorldCom, the company has made a series of announcements expanding its anticipated financial restatement due to the fraud, both in dollar amount and in time. In addition, the Commission has brought civil actions against four former employees of WorldCom. The Commission filed civil actions against former WorldCom Controller David F. Myers on September 26, 2002 (Litigation Release No. 17753); former WorldCom Director of General Accounting Buford ""Buddy"" Yates, Jr., on October 7, 2002 (Litigation Release No. 17771); and Betty L. Vinson and Troy M. Normand, former accountants in the WorldCom's General Accounting Department, on October 10, 2002 (Litigation Release No. 17783). All of these actions are pending. In determining to enter into the settlement, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by WorldCom and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

117,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced two enforcement actions - one settled and one unsettled - involving sales of mutual fund shares by Prudential Securities, Inc. (Prudential). In the settled action, the Commission found that from 1998 to 2000 Prudential, a registered broker-dealer, had inadequate systems in place to effectively monitor and enforce its policies and procedures relating to sales of different classes of mutual funds. In resolving the matter, Prudential agreed, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $82,000, which will be returned to investors harmed by the conduct described in the actions, and a civil penalty in the amount of $300,000. The respondents in the unsettled action are two former employees of Prudential. In multi-class mutual funds, the primary differences among the classes of shares are the type and amount of fees charged to investors. In today's actions, the SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that a former Prudential registered representative sold Class ""B"" shares to his customers, while failing to disclose that if they purchased Class ""A"" shares, they were eligible for breakpoint discounts based on the size of their mutual fund purchases. The Division further alleges that the respondents stood to make more money through sales of Class B shares than they would from sales of Class A shares. Mutual fund breakpoints are sales charge discounts available to customers who purchase large amounts of certain classes of shares in mutual funds that charge commissions. ""Mutual fund offerings have diversified with the industry's dramatic growth,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, ""Unfortunately, in some circumstances, abusive sales practices have accompanied the increasing sales of the various classes of mutual fund shares. Brokerage firms have a duty to ensure that the information they give their customers about different classes of mutual fund shares is complete and accurate, and that their recommendations are made for the benefit of customers, not themselves."" In the unsettled action, the Commission issued an administrative order instituting proceedings against Robert Ostrowski, a former Prudential registered representative, and Rees T. Harris, a former Prudential branch office manager. The Division alleges that on at least 42 occasions, Ostrowski, a registered representative in Prudential's Wilkes-Barre, Pa. branch office and a top seller of Prudential mutual funds, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with sales of mutual funds to his customers. Specifically, the Division alleges that on each of these occasions, Ostrowski sold his customers more than $100,000 of Class B shares in certain Prudential proprietary mutual funds without disclosing the existence of multiple classes of shares within the same fund, the fact that he had decided to purchase Class B shares for their accounts, and the existence of breakpoint discounts available with the purchase of Class A shares of the same funds. These discounts would have made large purchases of the funds' Class A shares less expensive investments for these customers than the same level of investment in Class B shares, which do not offer breakpoints. The Division alleges that Ostrowski received approximately $51,500 in excess commissions from his improper sales and that Prudential received approximately $63,000 in excess commissions. ""Prudential's settlement of the Commission's charges is a positive and constructive response to a serious supervisory failure,"" said Arthur S. Gabinet, District Administrator of the SEC's Philadelphia District Office. ""The Division of Enforcement has alleged that Mr. Ostrowski was one of Prudential's top mutual fund salesmen, but his customers suffered because he maximized his own returns rather than providing accurate and appropriate information to his customers."" The Division also alleges that Harris failed reasonably to supervise Ostrowski by failing to monitor his compliance with Prudential's policies and procedures regarding the sale of mutual fund shares. Harris approved all 42 of Ostrowski's sales of Class B shares in amounts exceeding $100,000 despite policies and procedures that specifically required Harris to ensure that registered representatives under his supervision discussed with customers, among other things, the availability of multiple classes of mutual fund shares and the various sales charges prior to a sale. A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge in the action against Ostrowski and Harris to determine whether the allegations contained in the order are true, to provide Ostrowski and Harris an opportunity to respond to them, and to determine whether any remedial action should be ordered, or penalties imposed, by the Commission. In the settled action, the Commission's order found that, although Prudential had policies and procedures prohibiting the type of sales practices that Ostrowski utilized, it did not have any systems in place to effectively monitor and enforce those policies and procedures above the branch office manager's level. As a result, when Harris failed in his supervisory responsibilities, Prudential had inadequate means to detect Harris' failure. The Commission found that, as a result, Prudential failed reasonably to supervise Ostrowski with a view to preventing his violations. In July 2001, following completion of an internal review, Prudential revised and enhanced its mutual fund policies and procedures, including those related to the sales of Class B mutual fund shares, and implemented systems to monitor compliance with them. In addition to paying $82,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $300,000 civil penalty, the Commission ordered that Prudential be censured and that it comply with its undertakings to, among other things, maintain the revised policies, procedures and systems that it has implemented.

118,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. (DeAM), the investment advisory unit of Deutsche Bank AG, for failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the 2002 merger between Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and Compaq Computer Corporation. The Commission's Order Instituting Proceedings finds that, unbeknownst to DeAM's advisory clients, Deutsche Bank's investment banking division was working for HP on the merger, and had intervened in DeAM's proxy voting process on behalf of HP. This created a material conflict of interest for DeAM, which had a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its advisory clients. The Order finds that DeAm violated this duty by voting the proxies on the HP stock owned by its advisory clients, without first disclosing the conflict. The Commission's Order censures DeAM, directs it to cease and desist from further violations, and imposes a civil penalty of $750,000. DeAM consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying its findings. ""Voting client proxies is a critical function of an investment adviser,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of the Division of Enforcement. ""If the adviser has a material conflict of interest, it must tell its clients about the conflict before voting so the clients can decide whether they want to vote the proxies themselves, allow the adviser to vote them, or make some other arrangement, such as having a shareholder service vote the proxies."" According to the Order, HP retained Deutsche Bank's investment banking division in January 2002 to assist in HP's hotly contested merger with Compaq. Pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with HP, Deutsche Bank did not publicly disclose that it was working for HP. Under the terms of the retention agreement, HP agreed to pay Deutsche Bank's investment banking division $1 million guaranteed, and another $1 million contingent upon the approval and completion of the merger. On Friday, March 15, 2002, the DeAM proxy committee cast all 17 million proxies on HP stock it controlled (on behalf of its clients) against the merger. The following Monday, HP management learned that DeAM had voted against the merger, and called senior-level officials of Deutsche Bank's investment banking division, and asked them to arrange for HP to make a last-minute presentation to the DeAM proxy committee. The Deutsche Bank investment bankers then contacted DeAM's then Chief Investment Officer, who agreed to allow HP, along with the principal dissident shareholder opposing the merger, to make presentations to the proxy committee the next day. Immediately following these presentations on the morning of March 19, 2002, the members of the DeAM proxy committee discussed whether they should switch their vote and cast the proxies in favor of the merger. During the discussion, the voting members were informed that Deutsche Bank's investment banking division was working for HP on the merger and that HP had an enormous banking relationship with Deutsche Bank. The committee then held a re-vote, and changed its vote in favor of the merger. Shortly before shareholder voting on the merger closed, DeAM personnel succeeded in recasting all 17 million of its clients' votes in favor of the merger. The Order finds that, due to the involvement of Deutsche Bank's investment banking division in the HP-Compaq merger and its intervention in the proxy voting process, DeAM had a material conflict of interest. As a result, prior to voting the proxies DeAM had a duty to disclose to its advisory clients the circumstances of its investment banking affiliate's work for HP on the proposed merger and the bankers' intervention in DeAM's voting process. Helane L. Morrison, the District Administrator of the SEC's San Francisco District Office, added, ""The Order does not find that the outcome of DeAM's proxy vote was affected by Deutsche Bank's investment banking relationship with HP. Rather, the Order emphasizes that the proxy voting process was tainted by the failure to disclose the conflict. The message is that the process matters."" Based on the foregoing, the Order finds that DeAM violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. For Further Information Contact: Helane L.

124,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced three related enforcement actions arising from trading in U.S. Treasury 30-year bonds minutes before the Treasury Department announced, on Oct. 31, 2001, that it would no longer issue such bonds. The Treasury Department's announcement had a dramatic market impact, causing the largest one-day price movement in the 30-year bond since October 1987. Goldman Sachs & Company (Goldman Sachs), Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), and Peter Davis, the individual who misappropriated the Treasury Department information that was subject to a news embargo, will pay a total of over $10.3 million to settle the Commission's actions. In a civil suit filed in federal court in New York, the Commission filed securities fraud charges against: Davis has entered into a settlement with the Commission. Youngdahl and Nothern are contesting the charges. Based on its former employee Youngdahl's conduct and on the bond trading that occurred as a result, Goldman Sachs has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm violated the anti-fraud laws applicable to broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers. The Commission's order also finds that Goldman Sachs lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants. Goldman Sachs will pay over $9.3 million in disgorgement of trading profits, interest, and penalties. The order also recognizes that Goldman Sachs promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commission's investigation. MFS has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants. MFS will pay a penalty of $200,000 and will reimburse another firm for over $700,000 in trading losses incurred by selling to MFS the bonds that Nothern and the other fund managers purchased. The Commission's order also recognizes that MFS promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commission's investigation. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, remarked: ""Acting quickly on market-sensitive news after it becomes fully public is one thing; tipping by a recipient of embargoed news, and trading based on such a tip, is quite another. The cases we have filed today make clear that the federal securities laws prohibit trafficking in confidential market-sensitive information about government securities as well as corporate securities. Moreover, if broker-dealers and investment advisers arrange to get potentially material information from outside sources, they must have specific policies and procedures in place to prevent illegal trading on that information."" The Commission's complaint against Davis, Youngdahl and Nothern alleges that Davis marketed himself to Wall Street clients by claiming special access that enabled him ""to get Washington information ahead of the media,"" and by promising clients ""the first call on investment issues they care about."" MFS retained Davis as a consultant sometime between 1995-1997, and Goldman Sachs retained Davis beginning in the spring of 2001. Youngdahl, who advised Treasury Desk traders on economic and political developments, was Davis' primary contact at Goldman Sachs. Nothern, who managed seven fixed income mutual funds for MFS, was Davis' primary contact at MFS. The complaint alleges that, since 1994, Davis had attended the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding press conferences. At these press conferences, the Treasury Department announced the Federal Government's financing requirements for the coming quarter. The complaint alleges that, in July 2001, Davis and Youngdahl agreed in a series of e-mails that Davis would provide Youngdahl with confidential information from the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding press conferences prior to the expiration of the embargo. Davis had previously conveyed confidential refunding information to Youngdahl in May 2001, and, pursuant to their July agreement, did so again in August 2001. The complaint further alleges that, at the Oct. 31, 2001, refunding press conference, Treasury Department officials announced three times that the information being made available was embargoed until 10:00 a.m. The press conference ended at approximately 9:25 a.m. Then, Davis, despite the officials' warnings, placed a series of cell phone calls to his clients, including Youngdahl and Nothern, beginning at 9:28 a.m., and told them that the Treasury Department was suspending future long bond issuances. The complaint alleges that Youngdahl knew that Davis, pursuant to their July agreement, was tipping him with confidential Treasury Department information before the information was released to the public. The complaint also alleges that Nothern knew, from a voice mail which Davis left him and which he listened to, that Davis had learned about the suspension of 30-year bond issuances directly from the Treasury Department, and that the news was embargoed until a scheduled 10:00 a.m. press announcement. The Commission's complaint charges Davis, Youngdahl, and Nothern with insider trading, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, and civil money penalties. Prior to the filing of the action, Davis consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction, and a court order that he disgorge $29,598, which represents the amount of consulting fees he received from Goldman Sachs and MFS plus prejudgment interest, and pay a penalty of $120,000. The Commission's administrative order against Goldman Sachs finds that, because of Youngdahl's conduct and the trading that ensued, Goldman Sachs willfully violated the provisions of the Exchange Act that prohibit fraud by broker-dealers and government securities dealers. The order also finds that Goldman Sachs did not have written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the firm's business, to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. During the relevant period, Goldman Sachs, and the Treasury Desk in particular, employed numerous paid consultants who provided a wide range of information and analysis. Although Goldman Sachs did have written policies on the proper handling and use of material, confidential information, these policies did not expressly address the use of such consultants or the handling of information obtained from them. Goldman Sachs consented to the Commission's order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. The order censures Goldman Sachs, orders the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders Goldman Sachs to disgorge $1,742,642 in bond trading profits and prejudgment interest, and to pay a penalty of $5,000,000. In addition Goldman Sachs is undertaking to disgorge $2,562,740 in bond futures trading profits and prejudgment interest. The Commission's order also requires Goldman Sachs' Legal Department to do a review of the firm's policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants. The Commission's Order against MFS finds that MFS lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information with respect to information obtained from consultants in violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Although MFS retained numerous paid consultants like Peter Davis, the firm's written materials on the use of nonpublic information only referenced inside information received from company insiders or their agents, and did not discuss the potential that paid consultants might provide such information. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, MFS consented to the entry of the Commission's order, which censures MFS, requires MFS to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders MFS to pay a penalty of $200,000. The order also requires MFS' General Counsel's office to do a review of the firm's policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants. In addition, MFS is undertaking to reimburse the broker-dealer that sold MFS the 30-year bonds $717,858, representing losses by the broker-dealer from selling 30-year bonds to MFS on Oct. 31, 2001, and prejudgment interest on that amount. The Commission has investigated this matter-which remains open-- in coordination with, and acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which has entered into a plea agreement with Peter Davis and obtained the indictment of John Youngdahl. The Commission also acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States Postal Inspection Service throughout this investigation.

Goldman Sachs & Company (Goldman Sachs), Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), and Peter Davis, the individual who misappropriated the Treasury Department information that was subject to a news embargo, will pay a total of over $10.3 million to settle the Commission's actions. In a civil suit filed in federal court in New York, the Commission filed securities fraud charges against: Davis has entered into a settlement with the Commission. Youngdahl and Nothern are contesting the charges. Based on its former employee Youngdahl's conduct and on the bond trading that occurred as a result, Goldman Sachs has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm violated the anti-fraud laws applicable to broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers. The Commission's order also finds that Goldman Sachs lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants. Goldman Sachs will pay over $9.3 million in disgorgement of trading profits, interest, and penalties. The order also recognizes that Goldman Sachs promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commission's investigation. MFS has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants.

128,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an executive who worked for a customer of Legato Systems, Inc. with aiding and abetting Legato's financial accounting fraud. Named in the Commission's complaint was Vincent Steckler, a former vice president of sales at Logicon, Inc., now Northrop Grumman Information Technology, a division of Northrop Grumman, Inc. According to the complaint, Steckler, 43, of Great Falls, Va., helped former Legato sales executives improperly record revenue on a sale to Logicon when Logicon was not committed to pay for the product. Recording this revenue caused Legato to overstate its 1999 third quarter operating income by 146%. The Commission previously charged Legato, its former chief financial officer and two former Legato sales executives in connection with the company's restatement of its financial results for the last three quarters of 1999. Helane L. Morrison, District Administrator for the Commission's San Francisco District Office, said, ""Sales executives who book phony deals often rely on assistance from people who work for their customers. Today's action highlights the Commission's resolve to hold such persons responsible when they knowingly assist in fraudulent revenue recognition practices."" The Commission's complaint alleges that Steckler assisted two former Legato sales executives in drafting a side letter in connection with an order by Logicon to purchase Legato software for resale to the U.S. Air Force. The side letter granted Logicon the right to cancel the transaction, and noted that the cancellation provision could not appear on the face of Logicon's purchase order ""because of the impact on revenue recognition."" Unaware of the side letter and the cancellation provision, Legato's finance department caused the company to recognize revenue on the order. As a result of this transaction, Legato's original Form 10-Q for the Sept., 30, 1999, quarter improperly overstated the company's net income by approximately $2 million (146%). Legato later restated this income, and the transaction was ultimately cancelled following the discovery of the side letter. The complaint charges that Steckler aided and abetted Legato and certain of its former officers in violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; provisions prohibiting the circumvention of Legato's internal accounting controls and falsification of its records, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1thereunder; and provisions requiring the company to provide accurate periodic reports and make and keep accurate books and records Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations by Steckler, as well as monetary penalties. In May 2002, the Commission sued Legato's former executive vice president of worldwide sales, David Malmstedt, and its former vice president of sales for North America, Mark Huetteman, for securities fraud for their roles in causing Legato to overstate its financial results for fiscal 1999. At the same time, Legato and its former chief financial officer, Steven Wise, consented to the issuance of a Commission order directing that they cease and desist from violations of the books and records, internal controls and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

(AIG) and others arising from an accounting fraud committed at Brightpoint, Inc. The fraud charges against AIG resulted from AIG's role in fashioning and selling a purported ""insurance"" product that Brightpoint used to report false and misleading financial information to the public. In settling the Commission's charges, AIG agreed to pay a $10 million civil penalty. The penalty reflects AIG's participation in the Brightpoint fraud, as well as misconduct by AIG during the Commission's investigation of this matter. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, remarked: ""This case shows that the Commission will pursue insurance companies and other financial institutions that market or sell so-called financial products that are, in reality, just vehicles to commit financial fraud."" Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said of the settlements: ""In this case, AIG worked hand in hand with Brightpoint personnel to custom-design a purported insurance policy that allowed Brightpoint to overstate its earnings by a staggering 61 percent. This transaction was simply a 'round-trip' of cash from Brightpoint to AIG and back to Brightpoint. By disguising the money as 'insurance,' AIG enabled Brightpoint to spread over several years a loss that should have been recognized immediately."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Associate Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""The $10 million penalty against AIG reflects the gravity of its misconduct. It also reflects the fact that, in the course of the Commission's investigation, AIG did not come clean. On the contrary, AIG withheld documents and committed other abuses, as outlined in the administrative order, compounding its overall misconduct."" In addition to AIG and Brightpoint, the Commission charged the following individuals: AIG developed and marketed a so-called ""non-traditional"" insurance product for the stated purpose of ""income statement smoothing,"" i.e., enabling a public reporting company to spread the recognition of known and quantified one-time losses over several future reporting periods. In this case, the key to achieving the desired accounting result was to create the appearance of ""insurance."" Specifically, AIG agreed to make it appear that the ""insured"" (Brightpoint) was paying premiums in return for an assumption of risk by AIG. In fact, Brightpoint was merely depositing cash with AIG that AIG refunded to Brightpoint. AIG issued the purported insurance policy to Brightpoint for the purpose of assisting Brightpoint to conceal $11.9 million in losses that Brightpoint sustained in 1998. Brightpoint's chief accounting officer, Delaney, and its director of risk management, Harcharik, negotiated the arrangement with Lucullo, then an AIG assistant vice president. Brightpoint's chief financial officer, Bounsall, approved the insurance transaction without adequately reviewing it. As a result of the transaction, Brightpoint's 1998 financial statements overstated Brightpoint's actual net income before taxes by 61 percent. Specifically, the Commission's Orders make the following findings of fact, which the respective respondents neither admit nor deny: During the course of the investigation of this matter, AIG failed to produce a large quantity of documents that were called for by the staff's various requests and subpoenas. In part, this failure resulted from a woefully deficient document collection effort within AIG, in which AIG failed to search various locations in which responsive documents were likely to be found. For example, AIG failed to examine the files of the former LMU president and other key individuals, and failed to conduct an adequate search of the LMU computer drive. In addition, in the fall of 2000, AIG chose to withhold a key document that the Commission believes should have been produced. AIG's misconduct in withholding this document until October 29, 2002 is compounded by the Commission's view that the document was directly relevant to positions taken by AIG in its Wells submission and in a meeting with the staff prior to that date. The Commission's settled administrative Orders make the following legal conclusions: The Commission's Orders direct each respondent to cease and desist from further violating the respective securities law provisions. The Commission's Order with respect to AIG also directs AIG to (i) disgorge, with prejudgment interest, the $100,000 fee it charged to Brightpoint for putting the Policy together, and (ii) retain an independent consultant to make binding recommendations concerning AIG's internal controls to ensure that AIG's insurance products will not be used in the future to violate the securities laws. The Commission has also filed a related civil action in federal court in Manhattan. Without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, all defendants except Harcharik have settled the civil action, with AIG agreeing to pay a $10 million civil penalty, Brightpoint agreeing to pay a $450,000 civil penalty, Bounsall agreeing to pay a $45,000 civil penalty and Delaney consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction barring future securities law violations, a permanent officer and director bar and a judgment ordering him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.

130,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative enforcement action against the Chicago Stock Exchange, finding that the Exchange failed to enforce certain of its trading rules. The Exchange consented to the entry of an order imposing a censure and requiring the Exchange to cease and desist from further violations of the federal securities laws and to comply with significant undertakings designed to enhance the Exchange's oversight of order handling by its members. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, stated, ""This case demonstrates that the Commission is and will continue to be vigilant and aggressive in ensuring that self-regulatory organizations fulfill their regulatory obligations."" Mary E. Keefe, Regional Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, stated, ""The Chicago Stock Exchange significantly expanded its trading volume without a commensurate expansion of its surveillance and disciplinary capabilities. As this case demonstrates, self-regulatory organizations must spend the necessary resources to improve and increase their surveillance and disciplinary capabilities to match any increase in activities conducted through their facilities."" The Commission's order includes findings that the Exchange neither admits nor denies. Specifically, the Commission found that the Exchange's surveillance program failed adequately to detect violations by its members of the firm quote rule, trading ahead prohibitions and the limit order display rule from 1998 through 2001. For instance, until early 2001, the Exchange's surveillance for intermarket firm quote rule violations was ineffective because it relied solely on telephone complaints alleging such violations. In another instance, from approximately June 1998 through August 2001, the Exchange failed to conduct any surveillance for intra-day trading ahead violations. In addition, the Commission found that even when the Exchange detected such violations, it often failed to take appropriate disciplinary actions against the individuals and/or firms that committed the violations. For instance, one Exchange co-specialist violated the firm quote rule up to 76 times in a 12-month period, yet the Exchange took no disciplinary action against this individual. This same individual traded ahead of customer orders on 37 occasions during the same period with no disciplinary consequences. These deficiencies were first detected by an inspection by the staff of the Commission's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. The Commission found that the Exchange violated Section 19(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires exchanges to enforce compliance by its members with the provisions and rules of the Exchange Act and with the exchanges' own rules. Among the undertakings required by the settlement are: (i) the creation by the Exchange of a Regulatory Oversight Committee comprised almost exclusively of individuals with no material business relationship with the Exchange, which Committee will regularly advise the Exchange's Board of Governors about regulatory, compliance and enforcement matters and assist the Board in monitoring the design, implementation and effectiveness of the Exchange's compliance programs; (ii) the engagement of an Independent Consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of the Exchange's trading floor surveillance and enforcement programs and provide recommendations to the Exchange; and (iii) the filing of various certifications by the Exchange's officials confirming its ongoing compliance with its statutory obligations. The Commission reiterates the importance of self regulatory organizations to fulfill their obligations in enforcing their rules. In particular, Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act requires a registered national securities exchange to be organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of the Exchange Act and to comply and enforce compliance by its members with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the Exchange.

132,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a settled civil injunctive action in federal court against J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (J.P. Morgan), a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., relating to the firm's allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings (IPOs) it underwrote during 1999 and 2000. In settlement of this matter, J.P. Morgan has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to a final judgment that would permanently enjoin J.P. Morgan from violating Rule 101 of the Commission's Regulation M and NASD Conduct Rule 2110, and order it to pay a $25 million civil penalty. The settlement terms are subject to approval by the court. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that J.P. Morgan violated Rule 101 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by attempting to induce certain customers who received allocations of IPOs to place purchase orders for additional shares in the aftermarket. The complaint further alleges that J.P. Morgan did in fact induce certain customers to place such orders and such customers often purchased stock during the new issues' first few trading days. The Commission's complaint also alleges that, in another instance, J.P. Morgan violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110, which requires member firms to observe just and equitable principles of trade, by persuading one or more customers in July 1999, to accept an allocation of a ""cold"" IPO (i.e., one where there is little interest in IPO shares) by promising the reward of an allocation of an upcoming oversubscribed IPO. ""This case is yet another example of the Commission's resolve to vigorously enforce those rules designed to ensure that the IPO allocation process and IPO market are fair to all investors,"" said Stephen Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""This case stands as a warning to all underwriters Ã¢ÂÂ they cannot engage in conduct that could distort the market for IPO stocks."" ""The IPO market must operate free from artificial influences,"" remarked Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""Any abusive allocation practices Ã¢ÂÂ from extracting explicit agreements about aftermarket purchases to attempting to induce purchases in the aftermarket Ã¢ÂÂ will not be tolerated."" The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations: Rule 101 of Regulation M, among other things, prohibits underwriters, during a restricted period prior to the completion of their participation in the distribution of IPO shares, from directly or indirectly bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any offered security in the aftermarket. As a prophylactic rule, Regulation M is designed to prohibit activities that could artificially influence the market for the offered security, including for example, supporting the IPO price by creating the perception of scarcity of IPO stock or creating the perception of aftermarket demand. During the restricted period, i.e., prior to J.P. Morgan's completion of participation in the distribution of IPO shares, J.P. Morgan attempted to induce certain customers to make aftermarket purchases in violation of Rule 101 of Regulation M by engaging in the following activities. In addition to its violations of Rule 101 of Regulation M, J.P. Morgan violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110 by persuading one or more customers in July 1999, to accept an allocation of Biopure, a ""cold"" IPO, by promising the reward of an allocation of IPIX, an upcoming oversubscribed IPO. J.P. Morgan had difficulties in generating sufficient interest for the Biopure IPO and therefore reduced the number of shares being offered, reduced the proposed price range and delayed the final pricing of the IPO. On the evening of July 29, 1999, when the Biopure IPO was ultimately priced, but before J.P. Morgan told customers what their Biopure allocations would be, the head of syndicate noted in an e-mail: ""IPIX allocations (very strong deal) will be heavily weighted toward those investors that participated in the Biopure offering . . . Given that we have fully allocated all accounts in the Biopure deal . . . it is extremely important that your investors take these allocations. I want to reiterate that we will provide you with the means to reward these clients.""

Named in the Commission's complaint are the following defendants.

Through these actions, the defendants gave the false and misleading impression that Gateway, unlike many of its competitors, was outpacing an industry trend of decreasing sales of personal computers. Stephen M. Cutler, SEC Director of Enforcement, said, ""The Commission continues to be absolutely committed to investigating and bringing complex financial fraud actions like this one. A fraud achieved through numerous small accounting tricks, as here, is just as harmful to investors as any other. We will hold accountable individuals who produce deceptive financial results, no matter what means they use."" term expectations of Wall Street analysts,"" said Randall R. Lee, Regional Director of the SEC's Pacific Regional Office. ""The former Gateway executives the Commission charges today were preoccupied with meeting analysts' expectations, to the extent that they fraudulently reverse-engineered Gateway's financial results to do so. This action also demonstrates the Commission's resolve to prosecute those executives, including CEOs, who mislead investors about the underlying health and business prospects of their companies."" The Commission's complaint alleges that in approximately May 2000, when defendants realized that the company would not meet the expectations of the Wall Street analysts who followed Gateway's stock, they embarked on a fraudulent scheme to ""close the gap"" between analysts' expectations and the company's actual revenue and earnings. approved financing to facilitate sales. The sales campaign to high-risk customers contributed more than 5% of Gateway's second quarter revenues. risk customers, he allegedly authorized a wider variety of improper accounting actions, all of which failed to comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These included (1) reducing loan loss reserves; (2) recognizing revenue from a consignment sale; (3) recognizing revenue from a purported bill-and-hold sale; (4) accelerating purported revenue from payments by America Online, Inc. (AOL) for bundling its internet service with a Gateway PC purchase; (5) recording revenue from the sale of the company's fixed assets; and (6) making additional undisclosed accounting adjustments to meet analysts' earnings estimates. over-year revenue growth of 16%. According to the complaint, these statements about Gateway's financial performance were false and misleading. The improper actions by defendants caused Gateway's net income for the third quarter of 2000 to be overstated by more than ten cents EPS, or 30%, and inflated reported revenue by $154 million, or 6.5%. keeping and internal controls provisions, and aiding and abetting Gateway's violations of the reporting and record-keeping provisions.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Gateway consented to the Commission's order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation or future violation of these provisions. In its order, the Commission also found that the Company's cooperation was not exemplary during the early stages of the staff's investigation.

163,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the institution and simultaneous settlement of an enforcement action against Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (Morgan Stanley) for failing to provide customers important information relating to their purchases of mutual fund shares. As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley will pay $50 million in disgorgement and penalties, all of which will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to certain Morgan Stanley customers. Stemming from the SEC's ongoing industry-wide investigation of mutual fund sales practices, this inquiry uncovered two distinct, firm-wide disclosure failures by Morgan Stanley. The first relates to Morgan Stanley's ""Partners Program"" and its predecessor, in which a select group of mutual fund complexes paid Morgan Stanley substantial fees for preferred marketing of their funds. To incentivize its sales force to recommend the purchase of shares in these ""preferred"" funds, Morgan Stanley paid increased compensation to individual registered representatives and branch managers on sales of those funds' shares. The fund complexes paid these fees in cash or in the form of portfolio brokerage commissions. Morgan Stanley also failed to adequately disclose at the point of sale the higher fees associated with large ($100,000 or greater) purchases of Class B shares of certain of its proprietary mutual funds. In connection with its recommendation to customers to purchase certain Class B shares, Morgan Stanley did not adequately inform customers at the point of sale that large purchases of such shares were subject to higher fees. Significantly, Morgan Stanley also failed to explain to customers that those fees could have a negative impact on customers' investment returns. As with the sales of funds in the ""preferred"" programs, Morgan Stanley's sales force stood to earn more on sales of Class B shares of its proprietary funds than on sales of Class A shares. The Commission's Order finds that this conduct violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 17(a)(2) prohibits the making of materially misleading statements or omissions in the offer and sale of securities. Rule 10b-10 requires broker dealers to disclose the source and amount of any remuneration received from third parties in connection with a securities transaction. The Order also finds that the conduct violated NASD Rule 2830(k), which prohibits NASD members from favoring the sale of mutual fund shares based on the receipt of brokerage commissions. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said: ""Unbeknownst to Morgan Stanley's customers, Morgan Stanley received monetary incentives -- in the form of ""shelf space"" payments -- to sell particular mutual funds to its customers. When customers purchase mutual funds, they should understand the nature and extent of any conflicts of interest that may affect the transaction."" Morgan Stanley has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission's Order. As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley will pay $25 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. In addition, Morgan Stanley will pay civil penalties totaling $25 million. The entire $50 million payment will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to customers who purchased ""preferred"" fund shares from January 1, 2000 through the present.

In connection with its recommendation to customers to purchase certain Class B shares, Morgan Stanley did not adequately inform customers at the point of sale that large purchases of such shares were subject to higher fees. Significantly, Morgan Stanley also failed to explain to customers that those fees could have a negative impact on customers' investment returns. As with the sales of funds in the ""preferred"" programs, Morgan Stanley's sales force stood to earn more on sales of Class B shares of its proprietary funds than on sales of Class A shares. The Commission's Order finds that this conduct violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 17(a)(2) prohibits the making of materially misleading statements or omissions in the offer and sale of securities. Rule 10b-10 requires broker dealers to disclose the source and amount of any remuneration received from third parties in connection with a securities transaction. The Order also finds that the conduct violated NASD Rule 2830(k), which prohibits NASD members from favoring the sale of mutual fund shares based on the receipt of brokerage commissions. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said: ""Unbeknownst to Morgan Stanley's customers, Morgan Stanley received monetary incentives -- in the form of ""shelf space"" payments -- to sell particular mutual funds to its customers. When customers purchase mutual funds, they should understand the nature and extent of any conflicts of interest that may affect the transaction."" Morgan Stanley has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission's Order. As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley will pay $25 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. In addition, Morgan Stanley will pay civil penalties totaling $25 million. The entire $50 million payment will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to customers who purchased ""preferred"" fund shares from January 1, 2000 through the present. In addition, Morgan Stanley has undertaken to, among other things, (1) place on its website disclosures regarding the Partners Program; (2) provide customers with a disclosure document that will disclose, among other things, specific information concerning the Partners Program, and the differences in fees and expenses connected with the purchase of different mutual fund share classes; (3) for those customers that bought certain Class B shares in amounts of $100,000 or more, offer to convert those customers' Class B shares to A shares; (4) retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of, and to provide recommendations concerning, Morgan Stanley's disclosures, policies and procedures and its plan to offer to convert Class B shares to A shares; and (5) adopt the recommendations of the independent consultant. Finally, the Commission's Order censures Morgan Stanley and orders it to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

STC received approximately $5.8 million in direct compensation from the hedge funds. STC, Seeger, Kenyon, and McDermott are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's action was brought contemporaneously with related actions by the New York Attorney General and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with whom the SEC has coordinated its efforts in this matter. The SEC also acknowledges the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration. Stephen M.

Cutler added, ""Today's important action was a product of swift investigation and effective cooperation by federal and state agencies alike."" Randall R.

The registration statements were allegedly false and misleading because they contained the fund prospectuses described above. Finally, the SEC seeks relief against IFG and Cunningham under Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act. This provision allows the SEC to seek injunctive relief against any investment adviser to or director of an investment company based on a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct.

The SEC's action was brought contemporaneously with a related action by the Attorney General of the State of New York. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""IFG and its CEO willingly sacrificed the interests of mutual fund shareholders when market timers dangled the prospect of higher management fees in front of them. By granting special trading privileges to selected customers, they readily violated the fiduciary duty they owed to all shareholders and rendered meaningless the funds' prospectus disclosures on market timing."" Randall J. Fons, Regional Director of the SEC's Central Regional Office in Denver, said, ""The sort of activity alleged in this complaint is an egregious and inexcusable violation of the trust that Invesco's public shareholders put in IFG. In circumstances like this, where a fiduciary puts its own interests before those of the fund shareholders, the individuals and entities responsible for the fraudulent conduct will be held accountable."" The SEC's complaint, filed today in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges the following. IFG is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Cunningham is charged with violating or aiding and abetting IFG's violations of these provisions. IFG and Cunningham are also charged with violating Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 based on the filing of materially false and misleading registration statements with the SEC. The registration statements were allegedly false and misleading because they contained the fund prospectuses described above. Finally, the SEC seeks relief against IFG and Cunningham under Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act. This provision allows the SEC to seek injunctive relief against any investment adviser to or director of an investment company based on a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct. The SEC's action seeks permanent injunctions against IFG and Cunningham, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

199,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced civil fraud charges against Mutuals.com, Inc., of Dallas, Tex., its CEO, its president, and its compliance officer, as well as two affiliated broker-dealer firms. According to the charges, the defendants deceived hundreds of mutual fund companies and their shareholders by improperly helping institutional brokerage customers and advisory clients carry out thousands of market timing trades and illegal late trades in shares of those mutual funds. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The defendants used a whole host of methods to try to mask their illegal market timing and late trading. These efforts at concealment illustrate the lengths to which the defendants were willing to go to continue enriching themselves at the expense of long-term mutual fund investors."" Harold F. Degenhardt, Jr., District Administrator of the SEC's Fort Worth Office, stated, ""The actions of these defendants are but another unfortunate example of the betrayal of mutual fund shareholders and, in this case, their mutual funds. The Commission is committed to rooting out this type of serious misconduct and holding all those responsible fully accountable."" Charged in the SEC's action are -- Mutuals.com, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser with 18 institutional and hedge fund clients and the adviser for the Mutuals.com Trust mutual fund (f/k/a 1-800 MUTUALS Advisor Series); Connely Dowd Management, Inc. (CDM) and MTT Fundcorp, Inc. (MTT), two affiliated broker-dealers; Richard Sapio, age 37, of Dallas, Mutuals.com's CEO; Eric McDonald, age 35, of Desoto, Tex., Mutuals.com's president; and Michele Leftwich, age 35, of Dallas, Mutuals.com's compliance officer. The SEC initially detected the alleged misconduct during an examination of the Mutuals.com investment complex in October 2003. ""Market timing"" refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing. Although market timing is not per se illegal, many mutual funds try to prevent it because it tends to harm long-term mutual fund shareholders. The SEC alleges that, between July 2001 and September 2003, hundreds of mutual fund companies and two clearing firms admonished Mutuals.com that its market timing activities were improper, and, by September 2003, approximately 294 different mutual fund companies had banned or otherwise restricted Mutuals.com from trading in their shares. In response, it is alleged that Sapio, McDonald and Leftwich devised and perpetrated a number of deceptive acts and practices to conceal their clients' market timing activities from those seeking to restrict them. Specifically, the Commission alleges that, in order to circumvent efforts to restrict their timing activities, Mutuals.com and its principals used a variety of deceptive means, such as (1) formation and registration of two affiliated broker-dealers (CDM and MTT) through which they could continue to market-time undetected; (2) changing account numbers for blocked customer accounts; (3) use of alternative registered representative numbers for registered representatives who were blocked from trading by mutual funds; (4) use of different branch identification numbers; (5) switching clearing firms; and (6) suggesting that their customers use third party tax identification numbers or social security numbers to disguise their identities, so that they could continue to trade in funds from which they had been banned. ""Late trading"" refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 ET, but at the net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close. Late trading enables the trader to profit from knowledge of market moving events that occur after 4:00 ET, but are not reflected in that day's fund share price. Late trading is illegal. With respect to late trading, the SEC charges that, at least during 2003, Mutuals.com and its affiliated broker-dealers routinely received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades as if the trading instructions had been received prior to that closing time. According to the SEC, Mutuals.com and its affiliates attempted to conceal late trading activities by omitting portions of the trading information that they were required to provide to clearing agents. In its action, the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions from further securities law violations, civil money penalties and disgorgement of illicit profits plus prejudgment interest. At the SEC's insistence, the defendants have agreed to a Court-appointed Special Monitor for Mutuals.com, to oversee management of the Mutuals.com Trust mutual fund (1-800 MUTUALS Advisor Series), pending the resolution of the civil litigation.

Although market timing is not per se illegal, many mutual funds try to prevent it because it tends to harm long-term mutual fund shareholders. The SEC alleges that, between July 2001 and September 2003, hundreds of mutual fund companies and two clearing firms admonished Mutuals.com that its market timing activities were improper, and, by September 2003, approximately 294 different mutual fund companies had banned or otherwise restricted Mutuals.com from trading in their shares. In response, it is alleged that Sapio, McDonald and Leftwich devised and perpetrated a number of deceptive acts and practices to conceal their clients' market timing activities from those seeking to restrict them. Specifically, the Commission alleges that, in order to circumvent efforts to restrict their timing activities, Mutuals.com and its principals used a variety of deceptive means, such as (1) formation and registration of two affiliated broker-dealers (CDM and MTT) through which they could continue to market-time undetected; (2) changing account numbers for blocked customer accounts; (3) use of alternative registered representative numbers for registered representatives who were blocked from trading by mutual funds; (4) use of different branch identification numbers; (5) switching clearing firms; and (6) suggesting that their customers use third party tax identification numbers or social security numbers to disguise their identities, so that they could continue to trade in funds from which they had been banned. ""Late trading"" refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 ET, but at the net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close. Late trading enables the trader to profit from knowledge of market moving events that occur after 4:00 ET, but are not reflected in that day's fund share price. Late trading is illegal. With respect to late trading, the SEC charges that, at least during 2003, Mutuals.com and its affiliated broker-dealers routinely received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades as if the trading instructions had been received prior to that closing time. According to the SEC, Mutuals.com and its affiliates attempted to conceal late trading activities by omitting portions of the trading information that they were required to provide to clearing agents. In its action, the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions from further securities law violations, civil money penalties and disgorgement of illicit profits plus prejudgment interest. At the SEC's insistence, the defendants have agreed to a Court-appointed Special Monitor for Mutuals.com, to oversee management of the Mutuals.com Trust mutual fund (1-800 MUTUALS Advisor Series), pending the resolution of the civil litigation.

209,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil enforcement action against four former senior executives of Nicor Energy LLC, alleging that the executives inflated net income by $11 million in 2001. Nicor Energy is a joint venture between Nicor Inc. and Dynegy Inc. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that the executives used an array of improper accounting tools for the express purpose of hitting earnings targets. In its case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the SEC alleged that the defendants, using Nicor as a conduit, defrauded the investing public regarding Nicor Energy's financial condition and results of operations for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. As a result of the fraud, Nicor Energy falsely reported to Nicor net income of $4.097 million instead of losses of $7.47 million for 2001, and these results were in turn reported to Nicor's investors. Also today, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois announced the indictment of three of the four executives, and one other individual. Stephen Cutler, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""Officers of a private entity such as Nicor Energy deceive the investing public when they provide false financial information to their parent corporation. The Complaint we filed today alleges that defendants did just that. We will seek stiff sanctions and work closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office to ensure that this serious breach of trust is addressed."" Robert Burson, Senior Associate Regional Director of the SEC's Midwest Regional Office added, ""According to the complaint, the defendants overstated Nicor Energy's unbilled revenue accounts, understated Nicor Energy's accounts receivable reserve, shifted 2001 expenses into 2002 and shifted 2002 income into 2001, all in order to inflate Nicor Energy's 2001 income by more than $11 million."" Named as defendants in the complaint are: The complaint charged the defendants with violating the antifraud and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder). It further charged the defendants with aiding and abetting Nicor Energy's violations of those same provisions. The complaint finally charged Stoffer as a controlling person for Nicor Energy's violations of those provisions. The SEC seeks an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating federal securities laws, granting civil penalties and permanently barring the defendants from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

210,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the first ""failure to supervise"" enforcement action against the principal of an unregistered investment adviser to a hedge fund. Previous failure to supervise actions against investment advisers had been brought only against registered advisers. In the same action, the Commission charged the adviser's director of investments with fraud. The Commission charged Wilfred Meckel, principal, and Robert T. Littell, director of investments, of Marque Millennium Group, Inc. (MMG), an unregistered investment adviser to three hedge funds called Marque Partners I (MPI), Marque Partners II and Marque Fund II Limited. The Commission charged Littell with defrauding investors in the hedge funds and Meckel with failing reasonably to supervise Littell with a view to preventing violations of the federal securities laws while Littell was subject to his supervision. Littell and Meckel each settled the actions without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement, said ""The Commission will use every available means to expose and to sanction securities fraud, including at hedge funds. To that end, the Commission will hold supervisors responsible if they do not take reasonable care to ensure that hedge fund employees act in the best interests of investors."" ""Whether registered or unregistered, employees of investment advisers and the hedge funds they advise can and will be subject to enforcement action if they fail to act appropriately to protect investors,"" said Mark K. Schonfeld, Associate Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. He added, ""Reliance on what a hedge fund employee says, without independent verification, is not good supervision."" The Commission's administrative order makes the following findings. From December 1998 through March 2000, MMG, through Littell, defrauded hedge fund investors and potential investors by: (1) communicating materially inaccurate performance information; (2) misrepresenting the hedge funds' management structure, retention of an accountant and auditor, and risk management techniques; and (3) improperly redeeming the full amount of investments by two large investors at a time when the hedge funds had incurred substantial undisclosed losses. Littell also concealed and attempted to conceal the hedge funds' losses from investors and from Meckel. The Commission's order also finds that Meckel failed to take reasonable supervisory actions, which could include maintaining accurate records of investments into and distributions from the hedge funds, review of daily trading activity, valuation of the hedge funds' positions, and separation of the hedge funds' trading and back office functions. Instead, Meckel relied on Littell's reporting and did not independently verify the performance information and other representations made by Littell. This delayed Meckel's discovery of Littell's misconduct and enabled Littell to continue his fraudulent activities. The Commission barred Littell from association with any investment adviser and ordered him to cease and desist from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and ordered him to pay a civil money penalty of $15,000. The Commission suspended Meckel from association in any supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for a period of six months and censured him. In determining appropriate sanctions, the Commission considered a financial statement submitted by Littell as well as remedial acts (including Meckel's payment of approximately $600,000 to reimburse Hedge Fund investors for losses) promptly undertaken by Meckel and the cooperation he afforded the Commission staff.

214,"The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed civil fraud charges against Security Brokerage, Inc. of Las Vegas and its president and majority owner, Daniel Calugar, for their participation in a scheme to defraud mutual fund shareholders through improper late trading and market timing. From at least 2001 to 2003, Calugar, trading through Security Brokerage, reaped profits of approximately $175 million from improper late trading and market timing, principally through mutual funds managed by Alliance Capital Management and Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS). Calugar, age 49, is an attorney with residences in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Based on the SEC's application, United States District Judge Robert Clive Jones of the District of Nevada issued a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of the defendants, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and granting expedited discovery. The court scheduled a hearing for January 5, 2004, on the SEC's application for a preliminary injunction. The SEC applied for the emergency relief after learning that on December 18, 2003, Calugar had transferred $50 million of proceeds from his scheme out of MFS. This transfer occurred on the same day that the Commission instituted an enforcement action against Alliance in connection with market timing activity. The Commission's action against Alliance identified Calugar as the largest market timer at Alliance. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, stated, ""Our enforcement action and request for an asset freeze against Daniel Calugar further reflect the Commission's resolve to ensure that the proceeds of illegal late trading and market timing are returned to investors. When we learned Calugar was seeking to transfer $50 million out of his mutual fund account, we took prompt action."" Randall R. Lee, Regional Director of the SEC's Pacific Regional Office, added, ""Calugar's market timing and late trading were phenomenally profitable to him and came at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders. By obtaining a court order freezing Calugar's assets, the Commission has taken action to preserve funds to be returned to the victims of his illegal schemes."" The SEC's complaint, filed in United States District Court in Las Vegas, alleges as follows: Security Brokerage and Calugar are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief granted by the court, the SEC is seeking a judgment of permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and monetary penalties.

215,"ÂÂ The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted enforcement proceedings against Paul A. Flynn, a former managing director of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), for his role in providing financing to hedge funds he knew were engaged in unlawful market timing and late trading of mutual funds. Flynn, age 46, is a resident of Larchmont, New York. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""We are committed to punishing not just those who engaged in the trading, but also those who facilitated it. Bankers, by providing financing to their hedge fund clients, now join the list of brokers, traders, and mutual fund advisers who have been charged with participating in unlawful mutual fund trading."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""The SEC will not permit bankers to turn a blind eye to the fraud they finance. This case should alert management at financial institutions that they will be held directly accountable when they knowingly finance fraud."" The Division of Enforcement (the Division) alleges that from 2001 to 2003, Flynn arranged for certain hedge fund clients, including Canary Capital Partners, LLC, to receive financing from a CIBC subsidiary. Flynn negotiated and structured swaps and loan agreements that provided these hedge fund clients with leverage to trade in mutual fund shares. The Division alleges that this conduct was fraudulent because Flynn was aware that these hedge fund clients were engaged in unlawful mutual fund trading through an electronic trading platform operated by Security Trust Company, N.A. (STC). According to the Division, Flynn made a due diligence trip to STC's offices during which he learned that the hedge funds used STC's trading platform for unlawful mutual fund trading. In a memorandum, Flynn described STC's ""Same Day/Late Day Trading Platform and the benefits this proprietary platform brings to our Mutual Fund Market Timing Clients."" First, Flynn's memorandum stated that, unlike standard platforms that require trades to be submitted before 4:00 p.m., clients using STC's platform ""are able to submit trades for same day value"" after 4:00 p.m. ""based upon published Net Asset Values (NAVs)."" According to Flynn's memorandum, ""[A] pricing list is prepared by the company and submitted to our clients who are then able to run their timing models against actual closing prices instead of the previous day before they submit trades."" Second, Flynn's memorandum explained that STC utilized several strategies to reduce the chance that mutual funds would detect the hedge funds' market timing and late trading: Thus, the Division alleges, Flynn was aware that by trading through STC, the hedge funds, and others were able to engage in late trading and to use deceptive means to evade the mutual funds' efforts to detect and prevent market timing. On Nov. 25, 2003, the SEC announced an action against STC and three former executives, arising from their participation in mutual fund late trading and market timing schemes. On December 9, 2003, Nicole McDermott, former vice president of corporate services at STC, and one of the defendants in the STC action, pleaded guilty in a related criminal action in a New York State court. 5 thereunder, and Rule 22c-1 promulgated under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

217,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has charged Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron Corp.'s former President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, lying to auditors, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The charges, which amend the Commission's Complaint filed against Richard A. Causey, Enron's former Chief Accounting Officer, in U.S. District Court in Houston, allege that Skilling and others engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud by manipulating Enron's publicly reported financial results. The Amended Complaint alleges that Skilling and others improperly used reserves within Enron's wholesale energy trading business, Enron Wholesale, to manufacture and manipulate reported earnings; manipulated Enron's ""business segment reporting"" to conceal losses at Enron's retail energy business, Enron Energy Services (""EES""); manufactured earnings by fraudulently promoting Enron's broadband unit, Enron Broadband Services (""EBS""); and improperly used special purpose entities (""SPEs"") and the LJM partnerships to manipulate Enron's financial results. In addition, the Amended Complaint alleges that Skilling made false and misleading statements concerning Enron's financial results and the performance of its businesses, and that these misrepresentations were also contained in Enron's public filings with the Commission. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Skilling sold Enron stock while in possession of material, non-public information that generated unlawful proceeds of approximately $63 million. ""In this scandal, as in others, we are by now all too familiar with executives who bask in the attention that follows the appearance of corporate success, but who then shout their ignorance when the appearance gives way to the reality of corruption. Let there be no mistake that today's enforcement action against Mr. Skilling places accountability exactly where it belongs,"" said SEC Enforcement Division Director Stephen M. Cutler. Added Deputy Director Linda Chatman Thomsen, ""Mr. Skilling embraced the sophisticated fraud underlying Enron's false reported financial results. To do otherwise would have discredited his much publicized business initiatives."" Specifically, the Commission's Amended Complaint alleges as follows: In the ""Nigerian barge"" transaction, Skilling and others agreed to a sham ""sale"" of an interest in certain power-producing barges off the coast of Nigeria to Merrill Lynch so that Enron could meet its fourth quarter 1999 budget targets. In order to induce Merrill Lynch to enter into the transaction, Enron promised - in an oral and undisclosed ""handshake"" deal - that Merrill Lynch would receive a return of its investment plus an agreed-upon profit within six months. As a result, Merrill Lynch's equity investment was not ""at risk"" and Enron should not have treated the transaction as a sale from which it could record earnings and cash flow. In June 2000, Enron delivered on its ""handshake"" promise. Causey and Fastow ensured that LJM repurchased the Nigerian barges from Merrill Lynch at the agreed-upon profit.Ã The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Department of Justice Enron Task Force, which filed related criminal charges against Skilling.

218,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action today in federal court in Boston alleging that Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. and Columbia Funds Distributor Inc. allowed certain preferred mutual fund customers to engage in short-term and excessive trading, while at the same time representing publicly that it prohibited such trading. Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. is a registered investment adviser that manages Columbia mutual funds; Columbia Funds Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that is the principal underwriter and entity responsible for selling the funds. Both are subsidiaries of FleetBoston Financial Corporation. According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 1998 through 2003, Columbia Funds Distributor secretly entered into arrangements with at least nine companies and individuals allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading in at least seven Columbia funds, including international funds and a fund aimed at young investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, in connection with certain of the arrangements, Columbia Distributor and Columbia Advisors accepted so-called ""sticky assets"" - long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the investors to actively trade in the funds. According to the complaint, after entering into these arrangements, the nine companies and individuals engaged in frequent short-term or excessive trading in at least sixteen different Columbia mutual funds. The SEC's complaint further alleges that executives of Columbia Funds Distributor entered into the arrangements, and that Columbia Management Advisors knew and approved of all but one of the arrangements and allowed them to continue despite knowing such short-term trading could be detrimental to long-term shareholders in the funds. According to the SEC's complaint, both defendants acted improperly in entering and accepting the short-term trading arrangements, because they were contrary to disclosures made in the prospectuses used to sell the mutual funds. Specifically, six of the nine arrangements were entered into or continued after Columbia adopted prospectus disclosure for the mutual funds expressly stating that the funds did not permit short-term or excessive trading. The complaint further alleges that allowing the frequent traders' investments increased the size of the funds and resulted in increased advisory fees to Columbia Management Advisors and increased Columbia Distributor's revenues. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement, said: ""By putting their own financial interests ahead of their clients' interests, this investment adviser and broker-dealer violated their most basic duties and violated the trust that mutual fund shareholders placed in them. The Commission will continue aggressively pursuing companies which, like these defendants, allow harmful trading in their own mutual funds."" Peter H. Bresnan, Acting District Administrator of the SEC's Boston District Office, said: ""Columbia had one set of rules for small investors, and another secret set of rules for certain big money players. At the very same time that defendants assured investors that short-term and excessive trading was not permitted, they were in fact entering arrangements to allow exactly that type of trading, which allowed the defendants to profit while investors were harmed. Mutual fund companies that fail to put the interests of investors first can expect the Commission to act swiftly and forcefully against them."" The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants had a duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Columbia mutual funds and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors. According to the complaint, despite this duty, the defendants never disclosed to fund shareholders or to the independent trustees of the funds that particular investors were being allowed to make short-term trades in the funds, or that Columbia Management Advisors had a conflict of interest because the short-term trading arrangements served to increase its management fees. The specific charges against the defendants in the federal court action are that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 1998 through 2003, Columbia Funds Distributor secretly entered into arrangements with at least nine companies and individuals allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading in at least seven Columbia funds, including international funds and a fund aimed at young investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, in connection with certain of the arrangements, Columbia Distributor and Columbia Advisors accepted so-called ""sticky assets"" - long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the investors to actively trade in the funds. According to the complaint, after entering into these arrangements, the nine companies and individuals engaged in frequent short-term or excessive trading in at least sixteen different Columbia mutual funds. The SEC's complaint further alleges that executives of Columbia Funds Distributor entered into the arrangements, and that Columbia Management Advisors knew and approved of all but one of the arrangements and allowed them to continue despite knowing such short-term trading could be detrimental to long-term shareholders in the funds. According to the SEC's complaint, both defendants acted improperly in entering and accepting the short-term trading arrangements, because they were contrary to disclosures made in the prospectuses used to sell the mutual funds. Specifically, six of the nine arrangements were entered into or continued after Columbia adopted prospectus disclosure for the mutual funds expressly stating that the funds did not permit short-term or excessive trading. The complaint further alleges that allowing the frequent traders' investments increased the size of the funds and resulted in increased advisory fees to Columbia Management Advisors and increased Columbia Distributor's revenues. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement, said: ""By putting their own financial interests ahead of their clients' interests, this investment adviser and broker-dealer violated their most basic duties and violated the trust that mutual fund shareholders placed in them. The Commission will continue aggressively pursuing companies which, like these defendants, allow harmful trading in their own mutual funds."" Peter H. Bresnan, Acting District Administrator of the SEC's Boston District Office, said: ""Columbia had one set of rules for small investors, and another secret set of rules for certain big money players. At the very same time that defendants assured investors that short-term and excessive trading was not permitted, they were in fact entering arrangements to allow exactly that type of trading, which allowed the defendants to profit while investors were harmed. Mutual fund companies that fail to put the interests of investors first can expect the Commission to act swiftly and forcefully against them."" The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants had a duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Columbia mutual funds and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors. According to the complaint, despite this duty, the defendants never disclosed to fund shareholders or to the independent trustees of the funds that particular investors were being allowed to make short-term trades in the funds, or that Columbia Management Advisors had a conflict of interest because the short-term trading arrangements served to increase its management fees. The specific charges against the defendants in the federal court action are that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Additionally, the SEC's complaint alleges that Columbia Management Advisors violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that Columbia Funds Distributor aided and abetted those violations; that Columbia Management Advisors violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; and that Columbia Funds Distributor violated Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, restitution of investor losses and civil penalties, and an order pursuant to Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act enjoining Columbia Advisors from serving as an investment adviser to any registered investment company. Today's actions reflect the coordinated efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General's Office, which today brought a related action against the same defendants.

223,"Sullivan Also Pleads Guilty to Criminal Charges Filed by the Department of Justice, Which Announces Related Indictment of Former WorldCom CEO Bernard J. EbbersWashington, D.C., March 2, 2004 Ã¢ÂÂ The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil enforcement action against Scott D. Sullivan, the former Chief Financial Officer of WorldCom, Inc. The Commission charged Sullivan with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to conceal WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs poor financial performance. The Commission alleged that Sullivan, with the consent and knowledge of WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs former Chief Executive Officer, caused numerous improper adjustments and entries in WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs books and records, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to make the companyÃ¢ÂÂs quarterly and yearly financial results appear to meet Wall StreetÃ¢ÂÂs expectations. In addition, the Commission alleged that Sullivan made numerous false and misleading public statements about WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs financial condition and performance, and signed a number of SEC filings that contained false and misleading material information. Also today, in connection with the same conduct, Sullivan pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by the U.S. AttorneyÃ¢ÂÂs Office for the Southern District of New York. In addition, that office announced today the related indictment of Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs former Chief Executive Officer. SEC Enforcement Division Director Stephen M. Cutler said, Ã¢ÂÂToday's plea by WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs former CFO, Mr. Sullivan, and the indictment of its former CEO, Mr. Ebbers, are important events in the history of securities enforcement. I am proud of the part our staff played in making these developments possible. No matter how high executives climb on the corporate ladder, they will never be above the law.Ã¢ÂÂ Lawrence A. West, an Associate Director in the SECÃ¢ÂÂs Division of Enforcement, said, Ã¢ÂÂThe process upon which we are now embarked will ensure that those most responsible for WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs fraud will be held strictly accountable and will permit the full story of this egregious fraud to be told. The CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs filing today of a partially settled civil action that will enjoin Mr. Sullivan and bar him from ever again acting as an officer or director of a public company or ever working in public accounting is only a start.Ã¢ÂÂ The CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs complaint against Sullivan alleges that by September 2000, Sullivan and other senior WorldCom executives knew that WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs true operating performance and financial results were materially below the financial guidance they had given to Wall Street analysts and investors. Rather than disclose WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs true financial condition and suffer the resulting decline in the companyÃ¢ÂÂs share price, from approximately September 2000 through June 2002, Sullivan engaged in a scheme that fraudulently concealed WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs true operational and financial results. The scheme involved improperly manipulating WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs reported revenue, expenses, net income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings per share. The complaint charges that as part of the scheme, Sullivan instructed subordinates to book certain fraudulent adjustments and entries in WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs general ledger. The adjustments and entries were designed to falsely increase WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs reported revenue and falsely decrease WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs reported expenses. The false adjustments and entries, among other things, improperly reduced expenses by drawing down certain reserves and improperly capitalizing certain operating expenses commonly referred to in the telecommunications industry as Ã¢ÂÂline costs.Ã¢ÂÂ The complaint also alleges that Sullivan misrepresented or failed to disclose material changes in WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs revenue recognition practices. During the same period, Sullivan and others made materially false or misleading statements or omissions to WorldComÃ¢ÂÂs independent auditors in connection with audits and the preparation of filings with the Commission. Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Sullivan has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. Sullivan has also agreed to the entry of an order that would permanently bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The order further provides that any monetary relief will be decided by the Court at a hearing to be held upon motion of the Commission or the instance of the Court and that the Court will retain jurisdiction of the action for all purposes, including the imposition of additional equitable remedies or sanctions, if any, as determined following a hearing. The settlement is subject to the review by and approval of the Court. In addition, Sullivan has agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs Rules of Practice. Sullivan has been licensed in the State of New York as a certified public accountant since 1985, although his registration lapsed in 1989. The CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs action against Sullivan is its fifth civil enforcement action related to the WorldCom fraud. The first was filed against WorldCom, Inc. on June 27, 2002, the day after WorldCom announced that it intended to restate its financial results for five quartersÃ¢ÂÂall quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 (Litigation Release No. 17588). The Commission sought, among other things, the appointment of a corporate monitor for WorldCom, and on July 3, 2002, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position. Since then, WorldCom has admitted that beginning in 1999, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, it materially overstated the income it reported in its financial statements by at least $9 billion. It also filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On Nov. 26, 2002, the Commission obtained a judgment against WorldCom that provided the full injunctive relief sought against the company. In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required the company to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws (Litigation Release No. 17866). Subsequently, the U.S. District Court ordered WorldCom to satisfy the SECÃ¢ÂÂs civil monetary penalty judgment by paying $500 million in cash and transferring $250 million worth of common stock in the reorganized company when it emerges from bankruptcy into a fund for later distribution to victims of the company's fraud, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds for Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Litigation Release Nos. 17829, 18219 and 18277). Previously, the Commission filed civil actions against former WorldCom Controller David F. Myers (Litigation Release No. 17753); former WorldCom Director of General Accounting Buford ""Buddy"" Yates, Jr. (Litigation Release No. 17771); and Betty L. Vinson and Troy M. Normand, former accountants in WorldCom's General Accounting Department (Litigation Release No. 17783). All of these actions are pending.

The violations occurred during a pending Commission investigation that is seeking to determine whether, among other things, BAS engaged in improper trading of securities prior to the firm's issuance of research concerning such securities. As part of the settlement, BAS has agreed to a censure and a $10 million civil penalty. The Commission found that BAS repeatedly failed to promptly furnish documents requested by the staff, provided misinformation concerning the availability and production status of such documents, and engaged in dilatory tactics that delayed the investigation. ""Today's action makes clear that we will not tolerate unreasonable delay in responding to our inquiries and will act aggressively to protect the integrity of the Commission's investigative processes,"" said Stephen Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. The Commission's order finds that BAS willfully failed to preserve or promptly furnish certain records after they were requested. In particular, the Commission found that BAS failed promptly to produce (i) electronic mail, including a particular e-mail exchange relating to matters that BAS knew were under investigation, (ii) certain compliance reviews, and (iii) compliance and supervision records concerning the personal trading activities of a former senior employee of the firm. In addition to the censure and $10 million penalty, BAS consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-4(j) thereunder. The Commission's investigation is continuing. Scott W. Friestad, Assistant Director, (202) 942-4732",-0.5,Negative
227,"The Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a settlement agreement in principle with Bank of America of securities fraud charges arising from arrangements to permit timing in certain Nations Funds mutual funds and for facilitating market timing and late trading by certain customers. The agreement in principle is subject to the approval by the Commission. Bank of America has agreed to pay a total of $375 million, consisting of $250 million in disgorgement and $125 million in penalties. The money will be distributed to the mutual funds and their shareholders that were harmed as a result of market timing in Nations Funds and other mutual funds through Bank of America. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement, said: ""The $375 million that Bank of America has agreed to pay and the significant reforms that it has agreed to implement reflect the seriousness of the misconduct in this matter. We will continue to investigate that misconduct in an effort to hold all responsible parties accountable."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Associate Director of the Northeast Regional Office, said: ""This settlement is a new benchmark in mutual fund market timing and late trading. Bank of America not only permitted timing in its own funds, it provided the instruments for timing and late trading of numerous other funds through its broker-dealer. This settlement will ensure compensation for all victims of the harm that resulted and prevent this misconduct from happening again."" The misconduct occurred both at Bank of America's mutual fund advisory subsidiary, Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (""BACAP""), and its broker-dealer subsidiary, Banc of America Securities, LLC (""BAS""). BACAP permitted the Canary hedge fund to engage in market timing in its Nations Funds. BAS facilitated market timing and late trading by Canary and others by trading through a BAS broker, Theodore C. Sihpol and by trading directly through BAS's clearing function through an electronic link. As part of the settlement, Bank of America will consent to a cease and desist order including securities fraud charges, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. Bank of America has represented that it will also exit the securities clearing business by the end of the year. Bank of America has also agreed to implement certain election and retirement procedures for the Nations Funds trustees that will result in the replacement of the Nations Funds trustees within one year. Bank of America has also agreed to certain undertakings that will strengthen the mutual funds' and broker-dealers' oversight of compliance with the securities laws.

232,"\- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange today announced the initiation and settlement of enforcement actions against five NYSE specialist firms. The firms will pay a total of $241,823,257 in penalties and disgorgement, consisting of $87,735,635 in civil money penalties and $154,087,622 in disgorgement, and implement steps to improve their compliance procedures and systems. The five settling specialist firms are: Bear Wagner Specialists LLC; Fleet Specialist, Inc.; LaBranche & Co., LLC; Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC; and Van der Moolen Specialists USA, LLC. In a joint investigation, the NYSE and SEC found that, between 1999 and 2003, the five firms, through particular transactions by certain of their registered specialists, violated federal securities laws and Exchange rules by executing orders for their dealer accounts ahead of executable public customer or ""agency"" orders. Through these transactions, the firms violated their basic obligation to match executable public customer buy and sell orders and not to fill customer orders through trades from the firm's own account when those customer orders could be matched with other customer orders. Through this conduct, the firms improperly profited from trading opportunities; disadvantaged customer orders, which either received inferior prices or went unexecuted altogether; and breached their duty to serve as agents to public customer orders. In the settlements, the firms have neither admitted nor denied the allegations. Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, said, ""When an exchange specialist unlawfully takes advantage of its privileged position by seizing trading opportunities that it should leave for public customers, it fundamentally undermines the fair and orderly operation of the exchange auction system. As the sanctions imposed in this case indicate, the Commission will aggressively punish such conduct."" ""The terms of this settlement are appropriate, and tell the investing public, specialists and all market participants that violations of NYSE rules and federal securities laws will not be tolerated,"" said Marshall N. Carter, NYSE director and chairman of the NYSE's Regulatory Oversight and Regulatory Budget Committee. ""Confidence in the integrity of our market is paramount. I am confident that the imposed sanctions and requirements for specialist firms to improve their own oversight and compliance functions will help deter future violative activity."" The settlement provides that the firms' $241 million payment will go to a Distribution Fund for the benefit of injured customers. This includes the $87,735,635 in civil penalties, which, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may be distributed to victims in SEC enforcement actions. Without admitting or denying the charges, the firms also will consent to charges that they (a) willfully violated Exchange Act Section 11(b) and Rule 11b-1 by failing to maintain a fair and orderly market through their improper proprietary trading; (b) violated various NYSE rules; and (c) in certain interpositioning transactions involving six stocks at each firm, failed adequately to supervise certain of their individual specialists, who themselves engaged in fraud through that proprietary trading in violation of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Barry W. Rashkover, Associate Director of the SEC's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""This landmark settlement underscores the obligation of exchange specialists to serve public customer orders over the specialist's own proprietary interests. The settlement is excellent news for injured customers. Because of the Distribution Fund, they will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the firms' sizeable payments."" ""This settlement reflects the culmination of a significant investigation and close cooperation between NYSE and the SEC,"" said David P. Doherty, executive vice president, NYSE Enforcement Division. ""It sends a strong message that our individual and combined regulatory efforts are vigorous and demand nothing less than full compliance."" The NYSE and SEC found that the improper proprietary trading took various forms. Sometimes, certain of the firms' specialists ""interpositioned"" the firms' dealer accounts between customer orders by trading into both of them in succession - for example, buying into a customer market sell order first, and then selling, at a higher price, into the opposite market buy order, thus allowing the firm dealer account to profit from the spread. The regulators also found that the specialists traded for their dealer accounts ahead of executable agency orders on the same side of the market, orders that were executed later at prices inferior to the prices of dealer account trades. At other times, the specialists traded ahead of executable limit orders, which then went unexecuted and ultimately were cancelled by the customers entering the orders. The NYSE and SEC found that the interpositioning transactions, in particular, were heavily concentrated in a few stocks overseen by a small number of specialists at each firm. With certain interpositioning transactions in six stocks at each firm, the NYSE and SEC found that certain unnamed individual specialists engaged in fraud by violating their implied representations to public customers that they were limiting dealer transactions to those ""reasonably necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market."" None of the specialist firms, according the findings, had in place reasonable systems or procedures to monitor, detect, or prevent those violations. The investigation is continuing. The NYSE and SEC will continue to coordinate in the investigation of individual responsibility for the violative conduct that is the subject of the enforcement actions announced today.

235,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) related to the company's use of mutual fund assets - namely, brokerage commissions on mutual fund transactions - to pay for the marketing and distribution of mutual funds in the MFS Fund Complex (MFS Funds). The Commission issued an order that found MFS failed to adequately disclose to the Boards of Trustees and to shareholders of the MFS Funds the specifics of its ""shelf-space"" arrangements with brokerage firms and the conflicts created by those arrangements. As part of the settlement, MFS agreed to a series of compliance reforms and to pay a penalty of $50 million, which will be distributed to the MFS Funds. The Commission's charges stem from an ongoing industry-wide investigation of mutual fund sales practices begun by the SEC in the Spring of 2003. That investigation previously led to a $50 million settlement with Morgan Stanley DW Inc. in November for that firm's failure to adequately disclose to its customers its receipt of such shelf-space payments from mutual funds. The Commission found that from at least Jan. 1, 2000, through Nov. 7, 2003, MFS negotiated bilateral arrangements, known as ""Strategic Alliances,"" with approximately 100 broker-dealers. Under these arrangements, MFS directed brokerage commissions on fund portfolio transactions to the brokerage firms in exchange for heightened visibility within the brokerage firms' distribution networks. Based upon negotiated formulas, MFS paid brokerage firms anywhere from 15 to 25 basis points (bps) on mutual fund gross sales and/or 3 to 20 bps on assets held over one year. MFS satisfied the Strategic Alliances in two ways: by paying cash, or ""hard dollars,"" and by directing brokerage commissions. When MFS satisfied the Strategic Alliances with brokerage commissions, it paid 1.5 times (or some other negotiated multiple) the amount it would have paid in hard dollars. MFS did not adequately disclose to the funds' Boards and shareholders the quid pro quo nature of these arrangements and the attendant conflicts of interest they created. ""A mutual fund manager's use of fund brokerage commissions to pay for the marketing and distribution of the fund creates a conflict of interest that must be fully and fairly disclosed,"" said Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""The Commission continues to investigate whether the managers of other mutual funds and the brokerage firms that sold those funds have similarly failed to disclose such conflicts."" ""This represents the first enforcement action against a mutual fund manager for its failure to adequately disclose payments for shelf space with fund brokerage commissions,"" said Merri Jo Gillette, Associate District Administrator in the SEC's Philadelphia District Office. ""This case underscores the fundamental disclosure obligation that investment managers, as fiduciaries, owe to their clients. In this case, the conflict arose because MFS used brokerage commissions, which are paid out of fund assets, rather than its own assets - in other words, cash - to satisfy the Strategic Alliances."" MFS agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. The Commission's Order censures MFS and orders it to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. MFS has permanently discontinued its use of fund brokerage commissions to pay for the Strategic Alliances. MFS has also undertaken to direct an independent consultant to conduct a review of, and to provide recommendations concerning, MFS's policies and procedures with respect to its Strategic Alliances including its disclosures to the Boards and shareholders, and to adopt the recommendations of the independent consultant.

236,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) related to the company's use of mutual fund assets - namely, brokerage commissions on mutual fund transactions - to pay for the marketing and distribution of mutual funds in the MFS Fund Complex (MFS Funds). The Commission issued an order that found MFS failed to adequately disclose to the Boards of Trustees and to shareholders of the MFS Funds the specifics of its ""shelf-space"" arrangements with brokerage firms and the conflicts created by those arrangements. As part of the settlement, MFS agreed to a series of compliance reforms and to pay a penalty of $50 million, which will be distributed to the MFS Funds. The Commission's charges stem from an ongoing industry-wide investigation of mutual fund sales practices begun by the SEC in the Spring of 2003. That investigation previously led to a $50 million settlement with Morgan Stanley DW Inc. in November for that firm's failure to adequately disclose to its customers its receipt of such shelf-space payments from mutual funds. The Commission found that from at least Jan. 1, 2000, through Nov. 7, 2003, MFS negotiated bilateral arrangements, known as ""Strategic Alliances,"" with approximately 100 broker-dealers. Under these arrangements, MFS directed brokerage commissions on fund portfolio transactions to the brokerage firms in exchange for heightened visibility within the brokerage firms' distribution networks. Based upon negotiated formulas, MFS paid brokerage firms anywhere from 15 to 25 basis points (bps) on mutual fund gross sales and/or 3 to 20 bps on assets held over one year. MFS satisfied the Strategic Alliances in two ways: by paying cash, or ""hard dollars,"" and by directing brokerage commissions. When MFS satisfied the Strategic Alliances with brokerage commissions, it paid 1.5 times (or some other negotiated multiple) the amount it would have paid in hard dollars. MFS did not adequately disclose to the funds' Boards and shareholders the quid pro quo nature of these arrangements and the attendant conflicts of interest they created. ""A mutual fund manager's use of fund brokerage commissions to pay for the marketing and distribution of the fund creates a conflict of interest that must be fully and fairly disclosed,"" said Stephen M.

""This case underscores the fundamental disclosure obligation that investment managers, as fiduciaries, owe to their clients. In this case, the conflict arose because MFS used brokerage commissions, which are paid out of fund assets, rather than its own assets - in other words, cash - to satisfy the Strategic Alliances.""

All of the money obtained by the Commission will be distributed to investors harmed by the market timing trading. Today's Order supplements a Commission Order entered on Nov. 13, 2003 (November 13 Order), pursuant to which Putnam agreed to undertake significant and far-reaching corporate governance, compliance, and ethics reforms. In the November 13 Order, the Commission found that, beginning as early as 1998, at least six Putnam investment management professionals engaged in excessive short-term trading of Putnam mutual funds in their personal accounts. Four of those employees engaged in such trading in funds over which they had investment decision-making responsibility. The November 13 Order further found that although Putnam became aware in 2000 that several investment management employees were engaging in potentially self-dealing short-term trading of mutual fund shares, Putnam failed to disclose this potentially self-dealing securities trading to the boards of the mutual funds it managed and the funds' shareholders. The November 13 Order censured Putnam and ordered it to cease and desist from violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The November 13 Order left open the amount of civil penalty and other monetary relief Putnam would be required to pay. Stephen M.

245,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Michael Resnick, Mark P. Kaiser, Timothy J. Lee and William Carter engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme to overstate the income of Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.) (Ahold) by $700 million or more in SEC filings and other public announcements for at least fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Resnick, Kaiser, Lee, and Carter were top executives at Columbia, Md., based wholesale food distributor U.S. Foodservice, a major subsidiary of Ahold. The complaint alleges that they grossly inflated reported profits and induced numerous suppliers to submit false confirmations to the company's auditors in order to conceal their fraud. The Commission alleges that Resnick, former CFO, Kaiser, former Chief Marketing Officer, Lee, former Executive Vice President of Purchasing, and Carter, former Vice President of Purchasing, violated the antifraud provisions; aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions; and violated and aided and abetted violations of the books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission also alleges that Lee engaged in repeated instances of tipping material, nonpublic information regarding Ahold's April 2000 tender offer acquisition of U.S. Foodservice. As a result of the tipping, an associate of Lee realized profits of at least $363,000 from trading in the stock of U.S. Foodservice. The Commission alleges that Lee, through his insider tipping, violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. In a related action, the Commission charged one of Lee's tippees, Peter O. Marion, with insider trading. ""Executives at U.S. Foodservice, as described in the complaint, went to extraordinary lengths to perpetuate the illusion of stellar financial performance. Their fraud created the appearance that they had met their budgets and allowed them to line their own pockets with unearned bonuses,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""To cover up their scheme, the defendants needed false confirmations from suppliers to defeat the audit process. It is disappointing that the defendants so successfully corrupted the audit and confirmation process. Let me note that the Commission's investigation is continuing,"" added Thomas C. Newkirk, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including performance based bonuses; imposing civil money penalties; barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and enjoining each of them from future violations or aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act SectionsÃ 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1. The Commission also seeks a final judgment enjoining Lee from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule14e-3. The Commission's complaint alleges that compensation for Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter was based, in part, on USF's ability to meet or exceed budgeted earnings targets. They each received a substantial bonus in early 2002 because USF purportedly satisfied earnings goals for fiscal year 2001. They were each eligible for a substantial bonus if USF met earnings targets for fiscal year 2002. They engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme whereby USF ""booked to budget"" -- reporting earnings equal to or greater than the targets, regardless of the company's true performance. The primary method used to carry out the fraudulent scheme to ""book to budget"" was to improperly inflate USF's promotional allowance income. A significant portion of USF's operating income was based on payments by its suppliers, usually referred to as promotional allowances. In a typical promotional allowance arrangement, USF would pay the full wholesale price for a product, then receive rebates of a portion of that price from the supplier if certain purchase volume and other conditions were met. They ""booked to budget"" by, among other things, causing USF to record fictitious promotional allowances sufficient to cover shortfalls to budgeted earnings. When questioned by Ahold's independent auditors about the promotional allowances recorded, Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee are alleged to have provided false and misleading justifications. They covered-up the false earnings by making it appear that the inflated promotional allowance income had been earned by, among other things, (a) inducing suppliers to confirm false promotional allowance income, payments, and receivable balances; (b) manipulating the promotional allowance receivable and manipulating and misapplying cash receipts; and (c) making false and misleading statements, and material omissions, to the company's independent auditors, other company personnel, and/or Ahold personnel. The Commission's complaint describes how Kaiser, Lee, and Carter, in order to keep the fraud from being discovered, participated in a systematic effort to corrupt the audit process. Ahold's auditors attempted at the end of each fiscal year to confirm with the vendors that they actually had paid, or still owed, the promotional allowances recorded by USF. The suppliers were convinced by Kaiser, Lee, and Carter to sign audit confirmation letters even though they knew that the letters were false. Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee, in order to prevent the discovery of the fraudulent scheme, took various additional steps to make it appear that USF's promotional allowance receivable balance was being paid by the suppliers. Among other things, they made, or caused to be made, accounting entries that unilaterally deducted material amounts from the balances that USF owed to the suppliers for the products USF had purchased, and simultaneously credited the promotional allowance receivable balance for the amount of such deductions. These ""deductions"" were made at year-end and had the net effect of making it appear that USF had made material progress in collecting promotional allowance payments allegedly due. Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee concealed the fact that the deductions were not authorized, were not legitimate, and that a substantial percentage of the deductions were reversed in the early part of the following fiscal year. The Commission further alleges that Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the amounts paid by some suppliers included prepayments on multi-year contracts. But they falsely represented to USF personnel, Ahold personnel, and/or the company's independent auditors that none of the promotional allowance agreements included such prepayments. As a result, USF treated the prepayments by suppliers as if they were payments for currently owed promotional allowances. This made it falsely appear that USF was making material progress in collecting the inflated promotional allowances income it had recorded. The Commission's complaint against Marion alleges that during the period Feb. 15, 2000, through March 1, 2000, after learning from Lee of Ahold's intention to acquire USF at a price of $24 to $26 per share, Marion purchased 36,000 shares of USF common stock at an average price of $14.92 per share. On March 7, 2000, Ahold and USF publicly announced Ahold's tender offer for USF at $26 per share. Marion sold his shares at an average price of $25.02 shortly after the tender offer was announced. As a result of his trading, Marion made illegal profits of approximately $363,894.

246,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Michael Resnick, Mark P. Kaiser, Timothy J. Lee and William Carter engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme to overstate the income of Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.) (Ahold) by $700 million or more in SEC filings and other public announcements for at least fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Resnick, Kaiser, Lee, and Carter were top executives at Columbia, Md., based wholesale food distributor U.S. Foodservice, a major subsidiary of Ahold. The complaint alleges that they grossly inflated reported profits and induced numerous suppliers to submit false confirmations to the company's auditors in order to conceal their fraud. The Commission alleges that Resnick, former CFO, Kaiser, former Chief Marketing Officer, Lee, former Executive Vice President of Purchasing, and Carter, former Vice President of Purchasing, violated the antifraud provisions; aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions; and violated and aided and abetted violations of the books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission also alleges that Lee engaged in repeated instances of tipping material, nonpublic information regarding Ahold's April 2000 tender offer acquisition of U.S. Foodservice. As a result of the tipping, an associate of Lee realized profits of at least $363,000 from trading in the stock of U.S. Foodservice. The Commission alleges that Lee, through his insider tipping, violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. In a related action, the Commission charged one of Lee's tippees, Peter O. Marion, with insider trading. ""Executives at U.S. Foodservice, as described in the complaint, went to extraordinary lengths to perpetuate the illusion of stellar financial performance. Their fraud created the appearance that they had met their budgets and allowed them to line their own pockets with unearned bonuses,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""To cover up their scheme, the defendants needed false confirmations from suppliers to defeat the audit process. It is disappointing that the defendants so successfully corrupted the audit and confirmation process. Let me note that the Commission's investigation is continuing,"" added Thomas C. Newkirk, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including performance based bonuses; imposing civil money penalties; barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and enjoining each of them from future violations or aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act SectionsÃ 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1. The Commission also seeks a final judgment enjoining Lee from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule14e-3. The Commission's complaint alleges that compensation for Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter was based, in part, on USF's ability to meet or exceed budgeted earnings targets. They each received a substantial bonus in early 2002 because USF purportedly satisfied earnings goals for fiscal year 2001. They were each eligible for a substantial bonus if USF met earnings targets for fiscal year 2002. They engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme whereby USF ""booked to budget"" -- reporting earnings equal to or greater than the targets, regardless of the company's true performance. The primary method used to carry out the fraudulent scheme to ""book to budget"" was to improperly inflate USF's promotional allowance income. A significant portion of USF's operating income was based on payments by its suppliers, usually referred to as promotional allowances. In a typical promotional allowance arrangement, USF would pay the full wholesale price for a product, then receive rebates of a portion of that price from the supplier if certain purchase volume and other conditions were met. They ""booked to budget"" by, among other things, causing USF to record fictitious promotional allowances sufficient to cover shortfalls to budgeted earnings. When questioned by Ahold's independent auditors about the promotional allowances recorded, Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee are alleged to have provided false and misleading justifications. They covered-up the false earnings by making it appear that the inflated promotional allowance income had been earned by, among other things, (a) inducing suppliers to confirm false promotional allowance income, payments, and receivable balances; (b) manipulating the promotional allowance receivable and manipulating and misapplying cash receipts; and (c) making false and misleading statements, and material omissions, to the company's independent auditors, other company personnel, and/or Ahold personnel. The Commission's complaint describes how Kaiser, Lee, and Carter, in order to keep the fraud from being discovered, participated in a systematic effort to corrupt the audit process. Ahold's auditors attempted at the end of each fiscal year to confirm with the vendors that they actually had paid, or still owed, the promotional allowances recorded by USF. The suppliers were convinced by Kaiser, Lee, and Carter to sign audit confirmation letters even though they knew that the letters were false. Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee, in order to prevent the discovery of the fraudulent scheme, took various additional steps to make it appear that USF's promotional allowance receivable balance was being paid by the suppliers. Among other things, they made, or caused to be made, accounting entries that unilaterally deducted material amounts from the balances that USF owed to the suppliers for the products USF had purchased, and simultaneously credited the promotional allowance receivable balance for the amount of such deductions. These ""deductions"" were made at year-end and had the net effect of making it appear that USF had made material progress in collecting promotional allowance payments allegedly due. Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee concealed the fact that the deductions were not authorized, were not legitimate, and that a substantial percentage of the deductions were reversed in the early part of the following fiscal year. The Commission further alleges that Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the amounts paid by some suppliers included prepayments on multi-year contracts. But they falsely represented to USF personnel, Ahold personnel, and/or the company's independent auditors that none of the promotional allowance agreements included such prepayments. As a result, USF treated the prepayments by suppliers as if they were payments for currently owed promotional allowances. This made it falsely appear that USF was making material progress in collecting the inflated promotional allowances income it had recorded. The Commission's complaint against Marion alleges that during the period Feb. 15, 2000, through March 1, 2000, after learning from Lee of Ahold's intention to acquire USF at a price of $24 to $26 per share, Marion purchased 36,000 shares of USF common stock at an average price of $14.92 per share. On March 7, 2000, Ahold and USF publicly announced Ahold's tender offer for USF at $26 per share. Marion sold his shares at an average price of $25.02 shortly after the tender offer was announced. As a result of his trading, Marion made illegal profits of approximately $363,894. The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering Marion to disgorge all illegal profits, with prejudgment interest thereon; imposing civil money penalties; and enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.

247,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today enforcement proceedings against Halliburton Co., its former chief financial officer, Gary V. Morris, and its former controller, Robert C. Muchmore, Jr. The Commission's actions are in response to Halliburton's failure to disclose a 1998 change to its accounting practice. As a result of that undisclosed change, Halliburton's public statements regarding its income in 1998 and 1999 were materially misleading. Halliburton and Muchmore have agreed to settle the enforcement actions by consenting to a Commission order to cease and desist from committing or causing future securities law violations. Additionally, Halliburton and Muchmore have agreed to pay penalties of $7.5 million and $50,000 respectively, in a related civil action. Halliburton's penalty for the disclosure failure reflects lapses in the company's conduct during the course of the Commission investigation, which commenced in mid-2002. Harold F. Degenhardt, Administrator of the Commission's Fort Worth office, commented, ""The SEC's action today emphasizes the importance of complete transparency in a company's financial disclosures. Important information bearing on a company's results should be clearly and timely disclosed, even if those results are calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)."" ""The penalty against Halliburton serves as yet another reminder that the Commission will not tolerate lapses by companies that serve to delay or hinder the Commission's investigative processes,"" said Spencer C. Barasch, enforcement head in the Commission's Fort Worth office. The Commission approved these enforcement actions following a thorough investigation that included the review of approximately 340,000 documents and sworn testimony from 23 individuals. The company's former Chief Executive Officer, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, provided sworn testimony and cooperated willingly and fully in the investigation conducted by the Commission's career staff. Today's enforcement actions include all of the charges that the Commission deemed appropriate in light of the investigative record developed by its staff. These actions conclude the Commission's investigation of Halliburton's 1998 change to its accounting practice. Halliburton provides a wide range of industrial construction services. In providing those services, Halliburton, at times, incurs cost overruns; the overruns may be recovered from Halliburton's customer depending on the terms of the construction contract and the nature of the overruns. Historically, Halliburton recognized income arising from cost overrun claims only in the financial quarter in which the claim was finally resolved with the customer. From 1993 to 1997, Halliburton had set forth this practice in its periodic filings with the Commission. In the second quarter of 1998, Halliburton changed its historical accounting practice and began recognizing revenues by offsetting losses on certain projects with revenues based on estimated probable recoveries on claims that had not been resolved with customers. Under the new practice, Halliburton recognized revenues on certain claims that the company believed were probable of collection rather than, pursuant to the prior practice, claims that had been finally resolved with its customers. Although both of Halliburton's claims recognition practices, the historical one and the revised one, are appropriate under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, there was a significant difference in their respective effects on Halliburton's financial presentation: the new practice reduced losses on several large construction projects. As a result, Halliburton's reported income was higher under the revised practice than it would have been under the prior practice. Over six reporting periods, spanning approximately 18 months covering 1998 and 1999, Halliburton failed to disclose its change of accounting practice. In the absence of any disclosure, the investing public was deprived of a full opportunity to assess Halliburton's reported income Ã¢ÂÂ more particularly, the precise nature of that income, and its comparability to Halliburton's income in prior periods. It was not until March 2000 that Halliburton, in its 1999 Form 10-K, disclosed its change in accounting practice. The following chart demonstrates the impact the undisclosed accounting change had on the company's pre-tax income in 1998 and 1999: These income figures appeared in Halliburton's filings with the Commission. They were also presented in the company's quarterly earnings releases and analyst teleconferences. The Commission alleges that Morris and Muchmore were responsible for the company's failure to disclose the accounting change, over six quarters, in Halliburton's Commission filings. Additionally, Morris and Muchmore played key roles in the preparation and review of quarterly earnings releases and analyst teleconference scripts that included the affected income figures. They were, therefore, also responsible for the absence in the releases and scripts of any clarifying reference to the accounting change or its impact. Halliburton and Muchmore neither admit nor deny the Commission's findings against them. The enforcement action against Morris is unsettled, and has been filed in U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Contact: Stephen M.

(the Funds), and Garrett Van Wagoner, the president of VWCM, relating to their misstatement of the valuations of certain securities held by the Funds. The settlement includes an $800,000 penalty from Van Wagoner and VWCM, a seven-year prohibition on Van Wagoner serving as an officer or director of a mutual fund, and a seven-year restriction on certain of Van Wagoner's activities with the investment adviser. In the Order Instituting Proceedings, in which Van Wagoner and VWCM neither admit nor deny the allegations, the Commission finds that Van Wagoner and VWCM misled the Funds' shareholders about the size and value of the Funds' investments in illiquid securities (securities that were not publicly traded or could not be sold readily), which obscured the fact that the Funds' holdings in those securities exceeded the limits promised in the Funds' shareholder disclosures. The Commission also announced actions against and settlements with: a former director of the Funds, Robert Colman, who purchased private equity securities in transactions at the same time as the Funds without first obtaining an order from the Commission permitting such joint investments; and a former private equity analyst of VWCM, Audrey L. Buchner, for prohibited, personal trading in the same public securities that the Funds also held or purchased, and omissions she made that concealed the overlap with the Funds' trading. ""Van Wagoner and his firm committed fraud by misleading mutual fund investors about an important and risky aspect of the Van Wagoner Funds' portfolio,"" said Helane L. Morrison, District Administrator of the SEC's San Francisco District Office. ""Van Wagoner and his firm betrayed the trust that investors place in mutual fund directors and managers to report their funds' market values accurately."" Added Michael S. Dicke, Deputy Assistant District Administrator of the SEC's San Francisco District Office, ""Today's separate Commission actions against Colman and Buchner confirm the Commission will continue to scrutinize personal investments by mutual fund insiders, including fund directors, especially when those investments contravene the insiders' obligations to the funds."" At the time of the misconduct by Van Wagoner and VWCM, the Funds included five publicly-sold mutual funds which invested primarily in technology stocks. From 1999 through 2001, Van Wagoner invested for the Funds in illiquid securities issued by private companies, with the hope that the investments would produce large returns when the private companies went public. However, these securities were risky to hold in large quantities because they could not be readily sold or valued based upon market quotations. To address the risks, Van Wagoner told the Funds' shareholders that he would endeavor to limit these investments to 15 percent of the value of the Funds' portfolios. Van Wagoner and VWCM misled the Funds' shareholders about these investments in two ways. Van Wagoner and VWCM, which neither admit nor deny the Commission's allegations in an administrative proceeding, have agreed to cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and the regulations under the Investment Company Act regarding the proper valuation of illiquid securities. They will also pay an $800,000 civil penalty. Under the settlement, Van Wagoner has agreed to resign from his position as president of the Funds, and not to serve as an officer or director of any mutual fund for a period of seven years. During the same seven year period, Van Wagoner also will not be making decisions regarding the Funds' liquidity or the valuation of private equity securities. VWCM also will initiate compliance measures designed to protect against future violations. The investment adviser will hire an independent consultant who will make recommendations to improve the procedures for determining the pricing and liquidity of private equity investments. Colman, who neither admits nor denies the Commission's allegations, has agreed to settle an administrative proceeding by paying a $25,000 civil penalty, disgorging director's fees he received between 1998 and mid-2000, plus interest, totaling $16,800, and agreeing to cease and desist from violations of the reporting and joint investments provisions of the Investment Company Act. Buchner, who neither admits nor denies the Commission's allegations, has agreed to settle an administrative proceeding by paying a $35,000 penalty and agreeing to cease and desist from violating the Commission's regulations that prohibit fund-affiliated persons from engaging in conduct that deceives a fund.

255,"\- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it had instituted settled enforcement proceedings against Bridgeway Capital Management (Bridgeway), and its president, John Noland Ryan Montgomery, in connection with more than $4.4 million in illegal performance-based fees that Bridgeway charged to three of its mutual funds. The settlement requires that Bridgeway reimburse the affected fund shareholders $4,407,700, plus prejudgment interest of $458,764, and that Bridgeway and Montgomery pay penalties of $250,000 and $50,000, respectively. Headquartered in Houston, Tex., Bridgeway manages 11 no-load mutual funds with combined net assets of approximately $1.4 billion. In its Order Instituting Proceedings, the Commission found that between July 1995 and March 2004, Bridgeway, at the direction of Montgomery, charged three of its mutual funds more than $4.4 million in illegal performance fees. Harold F. Degenhardt, Administrator of the Commission's Fort Worth Office, said, ""Mutual fund managers must ensure that advisory fees are assessed in strict accordance with the law. This is particularly true with respect to performance-based fees, which must be a fair reflection of a fund's performance during the entire performance period."" Fund managers are required to calculate performance-based fees (fees based on fund performance measured against a benchmark index) using the average value of the fund's assets over the same performance period that is used to measure the fund's performance. According to the Commission's Order, Bridgeway failed to comply with this requirement. Instead of using the average value of its funds' assets over the five-year period Bridgeway used to measure the funds' performance, Bridgeway calculated its performance-based fees using the funds' current asset values. Because the value of the three funds' currentassets typically exceeded the average value of the funds' assets over the five-year performance period, Bridgeway received excess performance fees when it met or exceeded its performance benchmarks Ã¢ÂÂ which it consistently did during the relevant period. (Conversely, in the few instances where Bridgeway failed to meet its performance benchmarks, the illegal performance-based fee resulted in lower fees than it would have otherwise earned.) The three funds and the amount of overcharges are as follows: As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission's Order finds that Bridgeway willfully violated, and Montgomery willfully aided and abetted and caused Bridgeway's violation of, Section 205(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which prohibits an investment adviser from entering into an advisory contract with a registered investment company that provides for performance-based compensation unless, pursuant to Section 205(b) of the Advisers Act, the contract provides for performance-based compensation based on the asset value of the fund averaged over a specified period and increasing and decreasing proportionately with the investment performance of the fund over a specified period in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices. Pursuant to their offers of settlement, Bridgeway and Montgomery neither admitted nor denied the findings in the Commission's Order. In addition to requiring the payment of disgorgement and penalties, the Commission ordered Bridgeway and Montgomery to cease and desist from committing or causing the above-mentioned securities law violations, and required Bridgeway to comply with certain undertakings, including hiring (or designating) experienced compliance personnel to ensure that Bridgeway applies its performance-based fee in accordance with the federal securities laws in the future.

261,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against John W. Adams, the former Chief Executive Officer of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., and AIP LLC, an entity managed by Adams that held a controlling interest in Hawaiian Airlines. Adams and AIP were charged for their role in Hawaiian's failure to disclose important negative financial information to shareholders in a tender offer from which Adams and AIP each benefited. During a June 2002 issuer tender offer in which Hawaiian repurchased $25 million in stock from its shareholders, Adams learned that the company's financial condition had significantly deteriorated, but failed to disclose the information to minority shareholders who were deciding whether or not to tender their shares. Minority shareholders who, unlike Adams and AIP, declined to tender their shares, found the value of their stock significantly diminished when the negative financial information was made public. Within nine months after the tender offer, Hawaiian was in bankruptcy. While certain minority shareholders lost their opportunity to realize the benefits of the tender offer, Adams and AIP benefited by more than $17 million by selling their shares to Hawaiian in the tender offer. Adams and AIP have agreed to a settlement in which, among other things, they agree to repay nearly $2.5 million in excess profits from their sales of Hawaiian stock in the tender offer. In connection with the settlement, Adams and AIP neither admitted nor denied the Commission's findings. Helane Morrison, District Administrator of the Commission's San Francisco District Office, said, ""Adams played a dual role as both CEO of Hawaiian and manager of its controlling shareholder, and he and AIP stood to profit if fewer minority shareholders tendered their shares. Adams was aware of the company's declining financial health, yet he did not provide that information to minority shareholders."" Added Marc Fagel, the Assistant District Administrator in San Francisco, ""Just as is the case with companies issuing stock to the public, companies offering to repurchase stock from shareholders cannot do so based on outdated, inaccurate information."" Also today, the court-appointed trustee for Hawaiian Airlines filed a motion recommending that the Bankruptcy Court accept a settlement reached between the Commission and Hawaiian relating to this matter. As part of the settlement, Hawaiian agreed to settle charges that in connection with the 2002 tender offer it violated Section 13(e)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13(e)-4(j)(2) thereunder, which require a public company conducting a self-tender offer to disclose promptly any material changes in the information provided to securities holders. Under the proposed settlement, Hawaiian consents to the entry of an order that it cease and desist from violations of these provisions. Hawaiian initiated the $25 million self-tender offer in June 2002, shortly after the company received $25 million in payments from the federal government to compensate air carriers for losses related to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Materials provided to shareholders represented that the tender offer was a prudent use of the company's resources, and that the company would remain solvent following completion of the tender offer. According to the Commission, however, Adams was aware that the company was experiencing a significant financial decline which was not disclosed to shareholders. Among other things, during the pendency of the tender offer Hawaiian revised its financial projections for 2002 from a $12 million operating profit to a $9.3 million operating loss. Adams and AIP tendered their shares and received over $17 million of the $25 million paid by Hawaiian for the stock. Had those Hawaiian shareholders who declined to tender their shares been informed that the continued solvency of the company was far less certain than initially represented, a proportionately smaller number of AIP's and Adams' shares would have been purchased by the company. Hence, AIP and Adams profited at the expense of non-tendering shareholders who were unaware of the company's financial decline. The Commission's Order charges Adams and AIP with causing Hawaiian's above-referenced violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Adams and AIP consented to an order that they cease and desist from causing violations of these provisions, and agreed to pay a total of approximately $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

262,"based Peregrine Systems, Inc. who orchestrated and attempted to cover up a massive accounting fraud at the company. According to the Commission's complaint filed in the United States District Court in San Diego, the Peregrine defendants fraudulently inflated the product revenue Peregrine reported in its filings with the Commission and elsewhere. The defendants employed deception and lies to portray Peregrine as a company with constantly growing sales while covering up Peregrine's persistent failure to fulfill revenue forecasts. At the same time, some of the Peregrine defendants unloaded Peregrine stock into an unsuspecting market, enriching themselves, in some instances by millions of dollars, at the expense of the investing public. reported revenue of $1.34 billion by more than $507 million. The Commission's complaint names: Stephen P. Gardner, Peregrine's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary L. Lenz, the former President and Chief Operating Officer; Douglas S. Powanda, the former Executive Vice President of Sales; Berdj J. Rassam, the former Controller; Joseph G. Reichner, the former Senior Vice President for Alliances and Business Development; and Peter J. O'Brien, the former Director of Strategic Alliances. The Commission also charged Daniel F. Stulac, a certified public accountant and former Arthur Andersen LLP engagement partner on the Peregrine audit, with fraud, and Larry A. Rodda and Michael D. Whitt, former principals of two Peregrine channel partners (customers), with aiding and abetting Peregrine's fraud. opted and join in the fraud.Ã¢ÂÂ binding arrangements with resellers (channel partners) Ã¢ÂÂ companies that purchased software from Peregrine for resale to end-users. Peregrine's senior management would determine near the ends of quarters how much additional revenue the company needed to meet or exceed analyst expectations. They would then enter into sham deals with channel partners (including backdated contracts and contracts made contingent by oral or written side agreements). Peregrine executives arranged a number of these fraudulent deals with defendants Rodda and Whitt. Peregrine improperly recorded the resulting Ã¢ÂÂrevenueÃ¢ÂÂ in order to mislead investors into believing that Peregrine's financial condition was significantly better than it was and to inflate artificially Peregrine's stock price. Gardner, the former CEO who was actively involved in the fraud, and Powanda, the former Executive VP of Sales who devised many of the sham deals, sold over $11 million and $24 million worth of Peregrine stock, respectively, during the fraud, resulting in millions of dollars in profits. The complaint further alleges that, as the uncollected receivables from the fake channel sales swelled on Peregrine's balance sheet, senior officers at the company devised a temporary solution to make it appear that Peregrine was collecting cash on a timely basis. Uncollectible receivables were purportedly sold to banks and removed from Peregrine's balance sheet. These receivable financing transactions, however, were in reality loans and not sales because, under the terms of the deals, the banks had recourse against Peregrine if the customers did not pay. Peregrine's removal of the receivables from its balance sheet was therefore fraudulent. According to the complaint, to prevent the banks from discovering that some of the channel Ã¢ÂÂsalesÃ¢ÂÂ underlying the receivables were bogus, Peregrine often repurchased the receivables from the banks. To remove the uncollectible receivables from Peregrine's books, Peregrine executives, including former Controller Rassam, with the knowledge of outside engagement partner Stulac, then improperly wrote off millions of dollars of the repurchased receivables (and other unpaid receivables) as acquisition costs, even though the receivables were wholly unrelated to acquisitions. The complaint also alleges that outside auditor Stulac permitted Peregrine to record revenue improperly. Stulac knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Peregrine's fiscal 2001 financial statements were materially false and misleading. Despite Stulac's knowledge or reckless disregard of this improper accounting, he caused Arthur Andersen to issue an unqualified opinion attesting to the accuracy and completeness of Peregrine's fiscal 2001 financial statements. settled civil injunctive action against the company (Litigation Release No. 18205A). In August of 2003, the Commission announced that it had fully settled its case against Peregrine and that the United States District Court in San Diego had entered final judgment (Litigation Release No. 18290). The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California also announced today criminal charges against the nine individuals named in the Commission's complaint, and others who participated in Peregrine's financial fraud. The Commission's investigation of the financial fraud is continuing. Former Peregrine officers and others are cooperating with the investigations.

263,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of enforcement actions alleging fraud and other violations against Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.) (Ahold) and three former top executives: Cees van der Hoeven, former CEO and chairman of executive board; A. Michiel Meurs, former CFO and executive board member; and Jan Andreae, former executive vice president and executive board member. The Commission also charged Roland Fahlin, former member of Ahold's supervisory board and audit committee, with causing violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws. The SEC's complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, allege that, as a result of the fraudulent inflation of promotional allowances at U.S. Foodservice, Ahold's wholly-owned subsidiary, the improper consolidation of joint ventures through fraudulent side letters, and other accounting errors and irregularities, Ahold's original SEC filings for at least fiscal years 2000 through 2002 were materially false and misleading. For fiscal years 2000 through 2002, Ahold overstated net sales by approximately EUR 33 billion ($30 billion). For fiscal years 2000 and 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002, Ahold overstated operating income by approximately EUR 3.6 billion ($3.3 billion) and net income by approximately EUR 900 million ($829 million). Ahold has agreed to settle the Commission's action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the company from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws. The charges against the individuals, all foreign nationals, are based solely on their roles in the improper consolidation of joint ventures. Van der Hoeven and Meurs have agreed to settle the Commission's action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to permanent injunctions and officer and director bars. Fahlin has consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, to the entry of a cease-and-desist order finding that he was a cause of Ahold's violations of certain provisions of the securities laws. The Commission has not sought penalties in the enforcement actions against the individuals because the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting a parallel criminal investigation in The Netherlands, has requested that the Commission not seek penalties against the individuals because of potential double jeopardy issues under Dutch law. Because of the importance of this case in The Netherlands and the need for continued cooperation between the SEC and regulatory authorities in other countries, the Commission has agreed to the Dutch prosecutor's request. The Commission did not seek a penalty from Ahold because of, among other reasons, the company's extensive cooperation with the Commission's investigation. Ahold self-reported the misconduct and conducted an extensive internal investigation. On its own initiative, Ahold expanded its internal investigation beyond the fraud at U.S. Foodservice and the improper joint venture accounting to analyze accounting practices and internal controls at seventeen operating companies. Ahold promptly provided the staff with the internal investigative reports and the supporting information and waived the attorney-client privilege and work product protection with respect to its internal investigations. Ahold also made its current personnel available for interviews or testimony, significantly assisted the staff in arranging interviews with, or testimony from, former Ahold personnel located in the United States and, of even greater importance, abroad. Ahold promptly took remedial actions including, but not limited to, revising its internal controls and terminating employees responsible for the wrongdoing. ""This case is yet another deplorable example of a massive, multifaceted fraud at a major corporation. Today, Ahold and former top executives are charged with fraudulently overstating sales by billions of dollars. The company is also charged with fraudulently fabricating hundreds of millions of dollars of earnings,"" according to Thomas C. Newkirk, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This case is also an example of the clear corporate advantage to conducting a comprehensive internal investigation and fully cooperating with the SEC,"" he said. ""This case also reflects the failure of a member of the company's audit committee to perform his duties to oversee the reporting process of a public company,"" said James Coffman, Assistant Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The proceeding initiated against Mr. Fahlin today demonstrates the Commission's commitment to bring enforcement actions against those board and audit committee members who fail to perform these important duties."" With respect to the fraud at U.S. Foodservice (""USF""), Ahold's wholly-owned subsidiary based in Columbia, Maryland, the Commission's complaint alleges as follows: The earnings inflation at USF, which began at least a year before Ahold's acquisition, is the subject of the SEC's complaint against four former USF executives filed July 27, 2004 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. With respect to the fraudulent consolidation of joint ventures, the Commission's complaints against Ahold, van der Hoeven, Meurs, and Andreae allege as follows: In its administrative action against Fahlin, the Commission alleges the following: Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaints, Ahold, van der Hoeven, and Meurs have agreed to permanent injunctions against future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws. Van der Hoeven and Meurs have also agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently barring them from serving as officers or directors of a public company. Fahlin has agreed to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings in the order, directing him to cease and desist from causing violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws.

266,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged San Francisco-based mutual fund adviser Fremont Investment Advisors with entering into improper and undisclosed agreements that allowed favored large investors to engage in rapid short-term securities trading known as market timing. Also charged by the Commission for their role in Fremont's improper market timing arrangements were former President and CEO Nancy Tengler and former Vice President of Institutional Sales Larry Adams. In addition to the market timing charges, the Commission charged Fremont for allowing mutual fund trades to be placed after the 4:00 p.m. market close. Fremont, a firm that managed 13 mutual funds during the relevant period and has approximately $2.8 billion in assets under management, has agreed to pay $4.146 million to settle the Commission's fraud charges. Tengler has also agreed to settle the Commission's action, agreeing to pay $127,000 in disgorgement and penalties and to be suspended from the industry for six months. Helane Morrison, District Administrator of the Commission's San Francisco District Office stated, ""By permitting select customers to engage in market timing and late trading, Fremont ignored its responsibility to treat all fund shareholders fairly and honestly."" Added Marc Fagel, Assistant District Administrator, ""This is a disturbing indicator that the abuses we have seen in the industry extended even to smaller, regional firms."" According to the Commission, Fremont's mutual fund prospectus prohibited market timing, and the firm enforced this policy by employing a ""timing cop"" to monitor and block excessive trading. Notwithstanding this policy, Fremont entered into undisclosed agreements in 2001 and 2002 allowing certain large investors to engage in market timing in Fremont's Global and U.S. Micro-Cap Funds. The Commission's order found that one of these agreements included a requirement that the investor place a multimillion-dollar long-term investment (or ""sticky asset"") in another Fremont fund, one recently established and co-managed by then-CEO Nancy Tengler. The Commission alleges that former Sales VP Larry Adams crafted the agreement, and finds that Tengler allowed the arrangement to go forward. The improper market timing arrangements generated additional fees of at least $170,000 for Fremont between 2001 and 2002, while allowing significant growth in the size of the fund established by Tengler. The Commission also found that a Fremont employee improperly authorized a brokerage firm to place mutual fund orders after the 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time market close, while still receiving the current day's price. This arrangement conferred an unfair advantage upon the broker's customers, allowing them the opportunity to profit from post-market close information and stale prices at the expense of other Fremont shareholders. Fremont was charged with, among other things, violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the findings, Fremont has agreed to settle the charges for $4.146 million, including disgorgement of $2.146 million and a civil penalty of $2 million. The Commission anticipates distributing the recovered money to investors of the mutual funds affected by the market timing. Fremont has further agreed to undertake certain remedial actions and to cease and desist from similar violations in the future. Nancy Tengler, also of the San Francisco area, was charged for her role in authorizing one of the improper market timing agreements. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Tengler has agreed to pay disgorgement of $27,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000, and has consented to an order suspending her from associating with an investment adviser or investment company for six months. Finally, the Commission instituted litigated administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against former Vice President of Institutional Sales Larry Adams, alleging that he negotiated an improper market timing agreement on behalf of Fremont and charging him with aiding and abetting and causing Fremont's violations of the Investment Advisers Act. The SEC's action was brought contemporaneously with a related action by the Attorney General of the State of New York. For more information, contact: Helane L.

267,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia) for violations of proxy disclosure and other reporting requirements in connection with the 2001 merger between First Union Corporation (First Union) and Old Wachovia Corporation (Old Wachovia). Under the settlement, Wachovia must pay a $37 million penalty and is to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. The Commissionâ??s Complaint alleges that Old Wachovia and First Union failed to disclose in quarterly reports and in a joint proxy statement-prospectus filed in connection with the merger, that Old Wachovia intended to â?? and did in fact â?? purchase $500 million of First Union common stock (FTU) during the period when First Union and SunTrust Banks, Inc. (SunTrust) had launched competing bids for Old Wachovia. Old Wachovia favored First Unionâ??s bid, which offered Old Wachovia shareholders shares of First Union stock in exchange for their Old Wachovia shares. As a result, Old Wachoviaâ??s shareholders were unable to evaluate the effect of Old Wachoviaâ??s purchases of FTU shares before voting on the competing bids. During the course of the SEC staffâ??s investigation into this matter, Wachovia provided incomplete and untimely document productions and failed to ensure comprehensive and complete responses to requests made and subpoenas issued by the SEC staff. These production deficiencies and delays unnecessarily prolonged the SEC staffâ??s investigation. The Commission took this conduct into account in setting the penalty in this case. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wachovia consented to entry of a judgment alleging violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder. â??A company must provide full and accurate disclosure with respect to its activities in the market during a takeover battle and cannot just rely on boiler plate disclosures,â? said Thomas C. Newkirk of the SECâ??s Division of Enforcement. â??The substantial penalty here reflects not only the seriousness of the disclosure violations but also the Companyâ??s failure to meet its legal obligations in the course of an SEC investigation,â? added Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Enforcement Division at the SEC. The Commissionâ??s complaint alleges: With respect to these purchases, neither First Union nor Old Wachovia disclosed in their Forms 10-Q and 10-Q/A filed in May and June 2001, or in the proxy statement-prospectus sent to over two hundred thousand shareholders on June 29, 2001, that: a) Old Wachovia authorized the purchase of FTU shares; b) subject to regulatory filings, Old Wachovia intended to purchase up to $500 million worth of FTU shares; and c) the total number of FTU shares that Old Wachovia purchased in May and June 2001. This material information was not disclosed until August 2001, after the shareholders voted on the merger. Old Wachovia should have publicly disclosed more detailed information about its purchases of FTU stock so that the market would be able to evaluate the effect of those purchases on FTUâ??s stock price during that period. By failing to disclose this material information, First Union and Old Wachovia violated Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Contact:Thomas C.

272,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Franklin Advisers, Inc. (FA) and Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. (FTDI) (collectively, Franklin), the investment adviser and principal underwriter and distributor affiliated with the Franklin Templeton mutual funds, alleging that Franklin, without proper disclosure, used fund assets to compensate brokerage firms for recommending the Franklin Templeton mutual funds over others to their clients. This practice is known as compensating brokerage firms for â??shelf space.â? As part of the settlement, Franklin agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $20 million penalty as well as undergo certain compliance reforms. The Commissionâ??s order finds, and Franklin neither admits nor denies, that between 2001 and 2003, FTDI had shelf space agreements with 39 broker-dealers pursuant to which FTDI allocated $52 million from brokerage commissions related to trades of fund shares (which were fund assets) to the broker-dealers in exchange for shelf space. Franklin did not adequately disclose these agreements to the fund boards or the fund shareholders. The use of brokerage commissions to compensate brokerage firms for marketing created a conflict of interest between FA and the funds because FA benefited from the increased management fees resulting from increased fund sales. Mutual funds that follow this practice of using brokerage commissions for marketing have an incentive to do their fund portfolio trading through brokerage firms that might not be the best choice for fund shareholders. FA was required, but failed, to disclose adequately the arrangements to the boards so they could approve this use of fund assets, and to shareholders so they could be informed when making investment decisions. FTDI aided and abetted FAâ??s violations. FTDI benefited from the arrangements by avoiding paying for shelf space out of its own assets. FTDI had the opportunity to disclose these agreements to the boards but failed to do so. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Deputy Director of the SECâ??s Division of Enforcement, said, â??This settlement reiterates the importance of proper disclosure to the fund boards. Franklinâ??s boards did not have sufficient information to assess the effectiveness of the advisers and distributors hired on behalf of the fund shareholders.â? Helane L. Morrison, District Administrator of the Commissionâ??s San Francisco District Office, stated, â??Franklinâ??s inadequately disclosed practice of using fund assets to compensate brokerage firms for shelf space interfered with the boardsâ?? ability to protect the interests of the fund shareholders. We think this settlement sends a strong message regarding the importance of full disclosure.â? The $20 million civil penalty will be distributed to the Franklin funds whose assets were used to pay for shelf space.

273,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Franklin Advisers, Inc. (FA) and Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. (FTDI) (collectively, Franklin), the investment adviser and principal underwriter and distributor affiliated with the Franklin Templeton mutual funds, alleging that Franklin, without proper disclosure, used fund assets to compensate brokerage firms for recommending the Franklin Templeton mutual funds over others to their clients. This practice is known as compensating brokerage firms for â??shelf space.â? As part of the settlement, Franklin agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $20 million penalty as well as undergo certain compliance reforms. The Commissionâ??s order finds, and Franklin neither admits nor denies, that between 2001 and 2003, FTDI had shelf space agreements with 39 broker-dealers pursuant to which FTDI allocated $52 million from brokerage commissions related to trades of fund shares (which were fund assets) to the broker-dealers in exchange for shelf space. Franklin did not adequately disclose these agreements to the fund boards or the fund shareholders. The use of brokerage commissions to compensate brokerage firms for marketing created a conflict of interest between FA and the funds because FA benefited from the increased management fees resulting from increased fund sales. Mutual funds that follow this practice of using brokerage commissions for marketing have an incentive to do their fund portfolio trading through brokerage firms that might not be the best choice for fund shareholders. FA was required, but failed, to disclose adequately the arrangements to the boards so they could approve this use of fund assets, and to shareholders so they could be informed when making investment decisions. FTDI aided and abetted FAâ??s violations. FTDI benefited from the arrangements by avoiding paying for shelf space out of its own assets. FTDI had the opportunity to disclose these agreements to the boards but failed to do so. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Deputy Director of the SECâ??s Division of Enforcement, said, â??This settlement reiterates the importance of proper disclosure to the fund boards.

275,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the institution of settled enforcement proceedings against First Command Financial Planning, Inc. (First Command), a registered broker-dealer whose customer base consists almost entirely of active-duty and retired U.S. Military personnel. The SEC alleges that First Command used misleading sales materials to offer and sell mutual-fund investments through an installment method called a systematic investment plan (systematic plan). The NASD today also initiated settled disciplinary proceedings against First Command based on similar allegations relating to the firmâ??s sales of systematic plans. In settlement of these actions, First Command has agreed to pay $12 million to be used to reimburse certain customers and to fund investor education programs for members of the U.S. Military and their families. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the SECâ??s Division of Enforcement, observed, â??First Command targeted members of our armed forces with investment sales pitches and comparative information that didnâ??t tell the full story. The SEC and NASD sanctions against First Command make clear that such practices arenâ??t acceptable. We hope that the investor education component of our settlement will provide a further check against those practices and help arm members of our military and their families with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed investment decisions in the future.â? Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, First Command has sales offices near U.S. military bases worldwide, and counts as its customers approximately forty percent of the current active duty general officers and approximately one-third of the commissioned officers. The vast majority of its sales agents are retired military officers. The systematic plans allowed investors to accumulate mutual-fund shares indirectly by making fixed monthly contributions â?? typically ranging from $100 to $500 â?? over a period of at least 15 years. The plans impose a unique sales charge or load that is equal to 50% of the planâ??s first 12 monthly payments with no sales load thereafter. Should the military customer make all of the required payments (180) over the 15-year period, the effective sales charge is approximately 3.3%. On the other hand, should the customer fail to make all of the required payments, the effective sales charge may be substantially higher. Historically, approximately 57% of First Commandâ??s customers failed to achieve the required 180 payments and, consequently, many of them paid a substantially higher sales charge than is customary for load equity mutual fund investments. The SEC, in its Order, finds that since at least January 1999, First Command offered and sold systematic plans by making misleading comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual-fund investments. For example, sales scripts utilized by the firm claimed no-load mutual funds â??frequently have some of the highest long-term costsâ? and are primarily for â??speculativeâ? investors. In reality, the average long-term costs of owning no-load funds are substantially lower than the costs of owning load funds, and many long-term investors invest in no-load funds. The SEC Order also finds that First Command sales materials contained misleading statements and omissions concerning the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan, a Federal Government-sponsored retirement savings and investment plan, which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and the efficacy of the upfront load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan. As part of its settlement with the SEC and NASD, First Command has agreed to compensate customers who purchased and terminated their plans after January 1999 and before the announcement of the SEC and NASD enforcement actions. By prematurely terminating their plans, these customers have incurred effective sales charges well above the average load charged by conventional-load equity mutual funds. In addition to the $12 million payment, the SEC has ordered First Command to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of certain provisions of the federal securities law, and to comply with certain undertakings, including hiring an independent consultant to review and make recommendations concerning the adequacy of First Commandâ??s sales scripts, sales training systems and procedures, and supervisory systems and procedures.

276,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against TV Azteca S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca or the company), a Mexican issuer whose American depository receipts trade on the NYSE, its parent company, Azteca Holdings, S.A., de C.V. (Azteca Holdings), and three current and former TV Azteca officers and directors, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Pedro Padilla Longoria, and Luis Echarte Fernandez. The SEC alleges in its complaint that the defendants engaged in an elaborate scheme to conceal Salinasâs role in a series of transactions through which he personally profited by $109 million. The SEC complaint also alleges that Salinas and Padilla sold millions of dollars of TV Azteca stock while Salinasâs self-dealing remained undisclosed to the market place. In its action, the SEC is seeking injunctions from future securities law violations, civil money penalties, and disgorgement of Salinasâ and Padillaâs ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest. The SEC also is seeking court-orders barring Salinas and Padilla from serving as officers or directors of any publicly-held company with securities trading in the United States. Spencer C. Barasch, head of enforcement for the SECâs Fort Worth office, commented, âEnhanced global cooperation among securities regulators has significantly changed the ways in which the SEC investigates and prosecutes conduct that crosses international borders. The cooperative efforts in this case of the SEC and the ComisiÃ³n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores in Mexico are a testament to the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative international enforcement. Securities regulators share a strong and mutual resolve to combat fraud; geographic boundaries will not serve to protect those who seek to defraud investors.â The SEC and CNBV are parties to a bilateral memorandum of understanding as well as to the International Organization of Securities Commissions multilateral memorandum of understanding, both of which significantly facilitate information sharing. The SECâs complaint names the following entities and individuals as defendants. TV Azteca, a Mexican corporation headquartered in Mexico City, is the second largest television broadcasting company in Mexico. TV Aztecaâs American depository receipts are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The companyâs underlying ordinary participation certificates trade on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, the Mexican stock exchange. Azteca Holdings, a Mexican holding company headquartered in Mexico City, beneficially owns 55% of the outstanding stock of TV Azteca. Azteca Holdings is indirectly owned and controlled by the Salinas family. Azteca Holdingsâ debt securities trade on the U.S. Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board Market. Salinas, age 49 and a Mexican citizen, has been the chairman of the board of directors and the controlling shareholder of TV Azteca since 1993. Salinas also has been chairman of the board, CEO and president of Azteca Holdings since 1997. Padilla, age 38 and a Mexican citizen, has been a director of TV Azteca since 1993, and was the CEO of the company from October 2001 through July 2004, when he was named CEO of Grupo Salinas, a de facto holding company for various Salinas controlled entities. Echarte, age 59 and a U.S. citizen, has been a director of TV Azteca since 1999. Echarte is also the president and CEO of Azteca America, a TV Azteca subsidiary based in New York, and is the chief financial strategist for Grupo Salinas. According to the SEC complaint, Salinas and others caused TV Azteca or Azteca Holdings to file periodic reports that did not disclose Salinasâs involvement in related party transactions between Unefon, a subsidiary of TV Azteca, and a private entity secretly co-owned by Salinas, called Codisco. In the related party transactions, Salinas purchased from a third partyâat a steep discountâapproximately $325 million of indebtedness owed by Unefon to the third party. At the time that Salinas purchased the indebtedness, he was aware that Unefon was in negotiations with another large telecom company which would provide substantial cash to Unefon, and enable Unefon to pay off the full amount of the indebtedness that Salinas had purchased at a discount. Only three months later, when Unefon closed the deal with the other telecom company, Salinas profited by $109 million upon Unefonâs repayment of the debt at full value. TV Azteca filed the false reports with the SEC, concealing Salinasâ involvement in the Unefon debt transactions, despite receiving advice from its U.S. counsel that these transactions were material, reportable transactions under U.S. federal securities laws. While the company provided general disclosure of the transactions, it refused to reveal information crucial to investors: that Salinas was behind the transactions and personally profited from them. TV Aztecaâs resistance led to the eventual resignation of its U.S. counsel, who told the companyâs board of directors and management that it was resigning consistent with its obligations under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In various filings and public statements from June 2003 through January 2004, TV Azteca and its management discussed publicly the Unefon debt transactions while either failing to disclose Salinasâs involvement, or, in several instances, falsely denying Salinasâs involvement. For example, Salinas publicly denied any connection to Codisco in response to a query by the press regarding market concern that he may have been affiliated with Codisco. TV Aztecaâs U.S. legal counsel subsequently discovered the news article containing Salinasâs false denial and advised Padilla that corrective disclosure was necessary. Despite the falsity of the statement, and the advice of counsel, the defendants did nothing to correct Salinasâs false denial. Further, in communications with TV Aztecaâs independent directors, Salinas, Padilla and Echarte intentionally withheld information from, and even lied to the directors about Salinasâs connection to the underlying transactions and his $109 million profit. Salinas and Padilla compounded their fraud by executing false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. After the resignation of TV Aztecaâs U.S. legal counsel and a Dec. 24, 2003, New York Times article concerning the matter, Echarte sent an email to Salinas and Padilla, stating, âThe damage is done and the situation that we didnât want to explain openly is now in the hands of the public.â Shortly thereafter, on Jan. 9, 2004, TV Azteca issued a press release confirming that Salinas indirectly owned half of Codisco. The SEC alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, reporting, concealment from auditors, books and records, internal controls, beneficial interest disclosure and Sarbanes-Oxley certification provisions of the federal securities laws. In a consent filed simultaneously with the complaint, Echarte settled the SECâs action against him by agreeing, without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating, and aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Echarte also has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $200,000 and disgorgement of $1. For further information contact: Harold F. Degenhardt, District Administrator, (817) 900-2607 Spencer C.

277,"The Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange today announced the institution and settlement of enforcement proceedings against Southwest Securities, Inc., a Dallas, Texas based broker-dealer and investment adviser, and three of its managers. According to the SEC and NYSE, Southwest and the managers failed reasonably to supervise brokers in Southwests downtown Dallas branch office who engaged in fraudulent mutual fund market timing schemes, late trading of mutual fund shares, or both. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil action in U.S. district court in Dallas today, against two former Southwest brokers, for allegedly engaging in a fraudulent market timing scheme. In that action, the SEC seeks injunctions, disgorgement of illicit profits, and civil money penalties, based on allegations that the two brokers committed securities fraud. In settlement of the SEC and NYSE actions, Southwest has agreed to pay a total of $10 million, consisting of $2 million in disgorgement and an $8 million civil money penalty, and to undertake a number of measures to prevent future misconduct. The managers have agreed to settlements that include payments of disgorgement and civil money penalties totaling $275,000, as well as 12-month suspensions from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser in any supervisory capacity. As part of the settlement, the firm and the managers neither admitted nor denied the SEC and NYSE findings. Harold F. Degenhardt, Director of the SECs Fort Worth Office, remarked, The SEC and NYSE actions against Southwest and three of its managers underscore the responsibility of broker-dealers and their managers to respond swiftly and completely when confronted with indications of late trading and improper market timing by their employees and customers. Spencer C. Barasch, Associate Director and head of enforcement at the SECs Fort Worth office, added, The actions against Southwest, its managers, and the registered representatives demonstrate the continuing resolve of the SEC and the NYSE to protect mutual fund investors from improper trading practices. Susan Merrill, Chief of Enforcement, NYSE Regulation, said, This action sends a strong message that member firms and their managers must diligently supervise their mutual fund trading business to prevent and detect market timing and late trading. They cannot ignore red flags that should alert them to their brokers improper conduct. Market timing refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing. Although market timing is not per se illegal, many mutual funds try to prevent it because it tends to harm long-term mutual fund shareholders. Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 ET, but at the net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close. Late trading enables the trader to profit from knowledge of market moving events that occur after 4:00 ET, but are not reflected in that days fund share price. Late trading is illegal. According to the SEC and the NYSE, the fraudulent market timing schemes sought to circumvent trading restrictions that mutual fund companies imposed on Southwest brokers and accounts, by concealing from mutual fund companies improper market timing activities of Southwest brokerage customers. The SEC and NYSE found and alleged that more than 30 fund companies, representing hundreds of individual mutual funds, detected market timing trades by Southwest customers, and attempted to prevent further market timing by barring future trades, either in particular accounts or by a particular Southwest broker or branch office. In response, according to the SEC and the NYSE, Southwest brokers used masking activities, such as multiple customer accounts, multiple broker identification numbers, and multiple branch office numbers, to disguise their customers market timing trades and trick the fund companies into accepting the trades. For example, according to the SEC and NYSE, brokers in Southwests downtown Dallas branch office executed trades for a single hedge fund adviser customer, using 21 accounts held by nine customer-affiliated entities, and using three broker identification numbers. According to the SEC and NYSE, the brokers used these masking tactics for the sole purpose of circumventing trading restrictions imposed by the fund companies. The SEC and the NYSE found that the managers failed reasonably to supervise the brokers, by failing to investigate or respond appropriately to red flags that should have alerted them to the brokers improper conduct. According to the SEC and NYSE findings, the red flags included hundreds of notices, warnings, complaints and trading restrictions (block notices) sent by mutual fund companies in response to the brokers mutual fund market timing activities, and also included the brokers requests for multiple account numbers per customer, and for additional broker identification numbers. The SEC and NYSE also found that Southwest failed to implement procedures designed to detect and prevent late trading. According to the NYSE and the SEC, Southwest also violated rules against late trading, and SEC rules that require broker-dealers to make and keep certain business records, including order tickets and electronic messages. The settled SEC and NYSE proceedings name Southwest and three of its managers, as follows: Southwest  The firm is a wholly owned subsidiary of SWS Group, Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the NYSE. The firm is a member of the NYSE, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), the Chicago Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange. Daniel R.

In settling the SEC and NYSE actions, Leland has agreed to pay disgorgement of $1 and a civil money penalty of $200,000, in addition to being suspended for twelve months from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser in any supervisory capacity. Kerry M. Rigdon  Rigdon was a senior vice president and the director of Southwests Private Client Group. In settling the SEC and NYSE actions, Rigdon has agreed to pay disgorgement of $1 and a civil money penalty of $50,000, in addition to being suspended for twelve months from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser in any supervisory capacity. Kevin J. Marsh  Marsh was a vice president and the branch manager of Southwests downtown Dallas branch office. In settling the SEC and NYSE actions, Marsh has agreed to pay disgorgement of $1 and a civil money penalty of $25,000, in addition to being suspended for twelve months from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser in any supervisory capacity.

Morrison, District Administrator of the SEC's San Francisco Office, stated, ""Calandra betrayed his readers' trust by surreptitiously using his newsletter, The Calandra Report, to bolster his personal trading profits. Calandra's readers were entitled to know about his trading activity, so that they could evaluate the credibility and impartiality of Calandra's investment advice for themselves."" According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Calandra made over $400,000 in illegal profits through a practice known as ""scalping""-buying shares of thinly-traded, small-cap companies, writing highly favorable newsletter profiles recommending the companies to his newsletter subscribers, and then selling the majority of his shares when the increased demand generated by his favorable columns drove up the stock price. From March to December 2003, Calandra followed this ""Buy-Write-Sell"" pattern for 23 different stocks that he covered in The Calandra Report, without disclosing his actions to his readers. In addition, the Commission alleged that Calandra failed to tell his readers that he had received compensation from a stock promoter affiliated with two mining companies that Calandra profiled in The Calandra Report. The compensation took the form of heavily-discounted shares in the two companies-shares which Calandra later sold at a substantial profit after the stock prices rose following his favorable newsletter write-ups. ""Calandra's violations were serious, but the penalty amount reflects Calandra's cooperation with the staff's investigation,"" said Marc J. Fagel, Assistant District Administrator of the SEC's San Francisco Office. Calandra, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Calandra also will disgorge $416,109.58 in illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest and will pay a civil penalty of $125,000. For more information, contact: Helane L.

280,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Google, Inc. with failing to register the issuance of option grants to employees or provide required financial information to the option recipients. According to the Commission, the Silicon Valley search engine technology company issued over $80 million in stock options to its employees in the two years preceding its IPO, yet failed to register the securities or make financial disclosures mandated by federal securities law. To settle the charges, Google and its General Counsel, David C. Drummond, agreed to cease and desist from violating the registration and related financial disclosure requirements. The Commission found that between 2002 and 2004, Google issued over $80 million worth of stock options to its employees as part of their compensation. The federal securities laws require companies issuing over $5 million in options during a 12-month period either to provide detailed financial information to the option recipients, or to register the securities offering with the Commission and thereby publicly disclose financial and other important information. According to the Commission, Google far exceeded the $5 million disclosure threshold, yet failed to register the options or provide the required financial information to employees. According to the Commission, Google - which, at the time, was still a privately-held company - viewed the disclosure of the information to employees as strategically disadvantageous, fearing the information could leak to Google's competitors. The Commission's order further finds that Google's General Counsel David Drummond, 41, of San Jose, Calif., was aware that the registration and related financial disclosure obligations had been triggered, but believed that Google could avoid providing the information to its employees by relying on an exemption from the law. According to the Commission, Drummond advised Google's Board that it could continue to issue options, but failed to inform the Board that the registration and disclosure obligations had been triggered or that there were risks in relying on the exemption, which was in fact inapplicable. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Enforcement Division in Washington, D.C., said, ""The securities laws exist to ensure full disclosure to investors, including employees accepting stock options as compensation. Companies cannot freely decide that they don't need to comply with the law."" Added Helane Morrison, District Administrator of the Commission's San Francisco District Office, ""Attorneys who undertake action on behalf of their company are no less accountable than any other corporate officers. By deciding Google could escape its disclosure requirements, and failing to inform the Board of the legal risks of his determination, Drummond caused the company to run afoul of the federal securities laws."" The Commission's Order charges Google with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, which imposes registration and disclosure obligations in the offer or sale of securities, and further charges Drummond with causing Google's violation. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Google and Drummond consented to an order that they cease and desist from violating or causing violations of Section 5. In a related matter, the California Department of Corporations announced that it had settled civil charges against Google for issuing certain stock options to Google's employees and consultants during 2003 without registering the offering and without providing financial information required to be disclosed under state securities laws in violation of Section 25110 of the California Corporations Code.

281,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (BACAP), BACAP Distributors, LLC (BACAP Distributors) and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS) for entering into improper and undisclosed agreements that allowed favored large investors to engage in rapid short-term securities trading known as market timing in certain Nations Funds mutual funds and for fraudulently facilitating market timing and late trading in Nations Funds mutual funds as well as unaffiliated mutual funds. The Commission ordered BACAP, BACAP Distributors and BAS to pay $375 million, consisting of $250 million in disgorgement and $125 million in penalties. The money will be distributed to the mutual funds and their shareholders that were harmed as a result of market timing and late trading in Nations Funds and other mutual funds. The Commission also censured BACAP, BACAP Distributors and BAS, ordered them to undertake certain remedial actions to strengthen their oversight of compliance with the federal securities laws, and ordered that they cease and desist from further violations. Mark K. Schonfeld, Regional Director of the Northeast Regional Office, said, ""Today's order details the conduct of Bank of America on three levels - as a mutual fund adviser, as a broker and as a clearing firm. As a fund adviser, BACAP permitted timing in its own funds. As a broker and clearing firm, BAS enabled late trading and market timing in many other mutual funds. This settlement will help ensure compensation for victims and help protect against a recurrence of such misconduct."" The Commission's Order finds that, from as early as July 2000 and continuing through July 2003, BACAP and BACAP Distributors entered into arrangements with two BAS clients and allowed them to engage in frequent short-term trading in at least 13 Nations Funds mutual funds, including international funds. In connection with one of these arrangements, BACAP and BACAP Distributors received ""sticky assets"" - long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the client to market time the funds. In addition, in 2002, the Board of Trustees of the Nations Funds approved a redemption fee on short-term trades in certain funds susceptible to timing, but simultaneously approved an exemption for one of these entities from the redemption fee. BACAP and BACAP Distributors did not disclose the existence of these approved timing relationships, or the fact that one of these clients was being exempted from the redemption fee, in prospectuses and proxy statements issued to shareholders and potential shareholders. The Commission also finds that BAS, a registered broker dealer, facilitated market timing and late trading by some introducing broker dealers and a hedge fund at the expense of shareholders of Nations Funds and other mutual fund families. These entities effected their late trading through BAS's ""Special Mutual Fund Order Entry System."" Once granted access to this system, these entities could and did enter mutual fund trade orders as late as 7:00 p.m. ET. BAS either knew or recklessly disregarded that these entities were engaged in late trading through this system. BAS also provided its introducing broker dealer clients with account management tools and other assistance that enabled the introducing broker dealers to conceal the market timing activities of their clients from unsuspecting mutual funds, and thus facilitated hundreds of market timing trades after the mutual funds had acted to block these entities from further trading. As a result, the Commission's Order finds that BACAP willfully violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(d), 20(a), and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 17d-1 and 20a-1 thereunder. It also finds that BACAP Distributors willfully violated Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder, as well as willfully aided and abetted and caused BACAP's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act. The Commission's Order further finds that BAS willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b 5, 15c1-2, 17a-3, and 17a-4 thereunder, and Rule 22c-1 as adopted under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act, as well as willfully aided and abetted and caused BACAP's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act and certain introducing broker dealers' violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b 5 thereunder. BACAP, BACAP Distributors and BAS consented to the entry of the Commission's Order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. In determining to accept the settlement, the Commission considered BACAP's, BACAP Distributor's, and BAS's cooperation in this investigation. The Commission also considered certain efforts voluntarily undertaken by BACAP, BACAP Distributors, BAS and the Nations Funds. Among other things, BAS voluntarily undertook to exit the unaffiliated introducing broker dealer mutual fund clearing business. The Nations Funds and the independent trustees also voluntarily undertook to implement certain election and retirement procedures that will result in the replacement of seven trustees by early 2005. The Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees of Nations Funds (Board), comprised entirely of independent trustees, is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on issues related to the composition and operation of the Board, including nominating replacements for these trustees.

286,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Frank J. Furino, a former clerk for a New York Stock Exchange floor broker, for his role in a fraudulent âtrading aheadâ scheme. Furino is charged with disclosing large, pending block orders from institutional customers to a day trader in return for cash payments between August 2000 and December 2001. The Commission alleges that the day trader traded ahead of the customer orders and profited on short-term price movements when the block order was filled. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement, stated, âCustomers expect that when they entrust their buy and sell orders to a floor broker, the floor broker - and its employees - will be acting as their agent. Furino breached that trust when, in exchange for cash payments, he provided information about pending customer orders to a day trader.â Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commissionâs Northeast Regional Office, stated, âIn lining his own pocket, Furino completely disregarded his duty - both to his employer and its customers - to handle his customersâ orders in the best interests of those customers. Such conduct threatens investorsâ ability to have orders executed on the best available terms and cannot be tolerated.â Furino, age 48, is a resident of Port Washington, N.Y. Until his recent termination, he was employed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a clerk for a floor broker, Jefferies Execution Services, Inc. and its predecessor, Lawrence Helfant LLC. The Commission alleges that between August 2000 and December 2001, Furino frequently alerted the day trader when institutional customers placed large orders with Helfant. Large orders can affect the market price of a stock by affecting the supply or demand for the stock. The day trader then âtraded aheadâ of the customer order â that is, bought or sold short the same security before Helfant executed the customer order. The day trader then closed his position as Helfant filled the customerâs order, realizing a profit from the movement in the stock price caused by the large order. By means of this scheme, the day trader made over $300,000 in trading profits on at least 58 trades. Helfantâs customers suffered losses because the scheme allowed the day trader to trade at more favorable prices than the customers were able to receive. Furino solicited and received from the day trader payments ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 per month over the course of the scheme. Furinoâs conduct breached duties of confidentiality and trust that he owed to his employer and to his employerâs customers. Furino also violated his firmâs written policies requiring confidential treatment of customer information, forbidding the use of confidential client information for personal benefit or for the benefit of another client, and forbidding acceptance of undisclosed compensation from clients. The Commissionâs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, charges Furino with securities fraud and seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, penalties, and an injunction against future violations. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York and the United States Postal Inspection Service.

288,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Frank J. Furino, a former clerk for a New York Stock Exchange floor broker, for his role in a fraudulent âtrading aheadâ scheme. Furino is charged with disclosing large, pending block orders from institutional customers to a day trader in return for cash payments between August 2000 and December 2001. The Commission alleges that the day trader traded ahead of the customer orders and profited on short-term price movements when the block order was filled. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement, stated, âCustomers expect that when they entrust their buy and sell orders to a floor broker, the floor broker - and its employees - will be acting as their agent. Furino breached that trust when, in exchange for cash payments, he provided information about pending customer orders to a day trader.â Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commissionâs Northeast Regional Office, stated, âIn lining his own pocket, Furino completely disregarded his duty - both to his employer and its customers - to handle his customersâ orders in the best interests of those customers. Such conduct threatens investorsâ ability to have orders executed on the best available terms and cannot be tolerated.â Furino, age 48, is a resident of Port Washington, N.Y. Until his recent termination, he was employed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a clerk for a floor broker, Jefferies Execution Services, Inc. and its predecessor, Lawrence Helfant LLC. The Commission alleges that between August 2000 and December 2001, Furino frequently alerted the day trader when institutional customers placed large orders with Helfant. Large orders can affect the market price of a stock by affecting the supply or demand for the stock. The day trader then âtraded aheadâ of the customer order â that is, bought or sold short the same security before Helfant executed the customer order. The day trader then closed his position as Helfant filled the customerâs order, realizing a profit from the movement in the stock price caused by the large order. By means of this scheme, the day trader made over $300,000 in trading profits on at least 58 trades. Helfantâs customers suffered losses because the scheme allowed the day trader to trade at more favorable prices than the customers were able to receive. Furino solicited and received from the day trader payments ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 per month over the course of the scheme. Furinoâs conduct breached duties of confidentiality and trust that he owed to his employer and to his employerâs customers. Furino also violated his firmâs written policies requiring confidential treatment of customer information, forbidding the use of confidential client information for personal benefit or for the benefit of another client, and forbidding acceptance of undisclosed compensation from clients. The Commissionâs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, charges Furino with securities fraud and seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, penalties, and an injunction against future violations.

289,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Zvi Fuks and Sabina Ben-Yehuda, two friends of the former CEO of ImClone Systems Inc., Samuel Waksal, with insider trading in ImClone securities in December 2001. The Commission charged that Ben-Yehuda and Fuks sold ImClone stock after receiving an illegal tip from Waksal just before the FDA denied approval of ImClone's cancer treatment drug. Fuks is the Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York, and in December 2001 was a member of the ImClone Scientific Advisory Board. In December 2001, Ben-Yehuda, a friend of both Fuks and Waksal, worked at Scientia, an investment vehicle set up by Waksal to invest in start up bio-tech companies. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, on the evening of December 26, 2001, Waksal learned privately and in advance of any official notice or public announcement, that the FDA would reject ImClone's application for approval of its primary product, a cancer treatment called Erbitux. Through a series of phone calls among Waksal, Ben-Yehuda and Fuks prior to the opening of the market the next morning, December 27, Waksal tipped Ben-Yehuda, who tipped to Fuks. At the opening of the market on December 27, Ben-Yehuda sold all 1,178 ImClone shares in her PaineWebber account for $73,453. Shortly after 10:00 a.m. that morning, Fuks sold all 89,173 shares of ImClone stock in his Bear Stearns account for over $5 million. ImClone publicly announced the FDA's decision at 6:00 p.m. on December 28, 2001. The news prompted ImClone's stock price to drop 16% by the close of the next trading day and resulted in the defendants illegally avoiding losses. The Commission seeks from both defendants permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the defendants' losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties. Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""This is yet another unfortunate instance of those with access to confidential information using it for their own advantage over the interests of other shareholders without the same access to ImClone's CEO."" The Commission previously settled a separate insider trading case against Waksal for conduct surrounding the same events. Waksal consented to the entry of an order (1) holding him jointly and severally liable with his father, Jack Waksal, for disgorgement of $1,947,804, representing Jack Waksal and Patti Waksal's losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest; (2) requiring Waksal to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $3,017,464; (3) ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $804,367, representing his daughter Aliza Waksal's losses avoided; (4) permanently enjoining Waksal from future violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws that the Commission charged him with violating; and (5) permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of any public company.

290,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joseph P. Nacchio, former co-chairman and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International Inc., and eight other former Qwest officers and employees with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws. In three separate but related civil actions, the Commission alleges that, between 1999 and 2002, the Qwest defendants engaged in a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme designed to mislead the investing public about the company's revenue and growth. According to the SEC's complaints filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Nacchio and others made numerous false and misleading statements about Qwest's financial condition in annual, quarterly, and current reports, in registration statements that incorporated Qwest's financial statements, and in other public statements, including earnings releases and investor calls,. As a result of that scheme, Qwest fraudulently recognized over $3 billion of revenue and excluded $71.3 million in expenses. The Commission, in October 2004, sued Qwest in a settled injunctive action in which the company agreed to pay a $250 million penalty for its misconduct. In addition to Nacchio, the Commission's complaints name former chief financial officers Robert S. Woodruff and Robin R. Szeliga, former chief operating officer Afshin Mohebbi, former executive vice president of wholesale markets Gregory M. Casey, former senior vice president of pricing and offer management Roger B. Hoaglund, former senior vice president of finance William L. Eveleth, former director of financial reporting James J. Kozlowski, and former senior manager of financial reporting Frank T. Noyes. The complaints seek injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all of the defendants, and officer/director bars against Nacchio, Woodruff, Szeliga, Mohebbi, Casey, and Eveleth. ""The disclosure fraud at Qwest was orchestrated at the highest level of the company to deceive investors,"" said Randall J. Fons, Regional Director of the Commission's Central Regional Office in Denver. ""Qwest's CEO and other top executives projected revenue and earnings that they knew were overly aggressive, and then all of the defendants used smoke and mirrors to meet those unrealistic projections. These individuals must now answer for their conduct and the enormous decline in shareholder value that they caused."" Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Joseph Nacchio and others at Qwest wanted the company's shareholders to believe that the company was doing better than it actually was. Today's enforcement action once again tells corporate executives that they will be held personally accountable when they keep the truth from the marketplace."" The Commission's complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, allege as follows. In Commission filings and other public statements, Nacchio, Woodruff, and Szeliga fraudulently characterized nonrecurring revenue from the one-time sales of capacity in the form of indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) and equipment as recurring ""data and Internet service revenues,"" thereby masking Qwest's declining financial condition and artificially inflating its stock price. Qwest used such nonrecurring revenue to fill the gap between actual and projected revenue. Over time, in fact, Qwest's dependence on such one-time transactions grew to the point that it was likened internally to an ""addiction"" and the nonrecurring IRU and equipment sale transactions were likened to ""heroin."" Among other things, the Qwest executives' misrepresentations about Qwest's revenue sources allowed Qwest to maintain a stock price sufficiently high to complete its pending merger with US West, Inc. Without admitting or denying any allegations, Hoaglund consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and directing him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and disgorgement of $200,000 plus prejudgment interest. Similarly, without admitting or denying any allegations, Eveleth consented to entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, directing him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000 and disgorgement of $35,575 plus prejudgment interest, and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company for five years. On March 15, 2005, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Mark A. Schumacher and Brian K.

293,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Time Warner Inc. (formerly known as AOL Time Warner) with materially overstating online advertising revenue and the number of its Internet subscribers, and with aiding and abetting three other securities frauds. The Commission also charged that the company violated a Commission cease-and-desist order issued against America Online, Inc. on May 15, 2000. In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission charged Time Warner CFO Wayne H. Pace, Controller James W. Barge, and Deputy Controller Pascal Desroches with causing violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Time Warner consented to the entry of a judgment that, among other things, orders it to pay $300 million in civil penalties, which the Commission will request be distributed to harmed investors. The penalties cannot be used to offset any judgment or settlement in any related shareholder suit. The judgment further orders the company to comply with the Commission's May 15, 2000 cease-and-desist order against AOL; enjoins the company from violating antifraud, reporting, books-and-records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws; and enjoins the company from aiding and abetting securities fraud. As part of the settlement, Time Warner agreed to restate its historical financial results to reduce its reported online advertising revenues by approximately $500 million (in addition to the $190 million already restated) for the fourth quarter of 2000 through 2002 and to properly reflect the consolidation of AOL Europe in the company's 2000 and 2001 financial statements. The company also agreed to engage an independent examiner to determine whether the company's historical accounting for certain transactions was in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the separate administrative action, Pace, Barge, and Desroches consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a Commission cease-and-desist order that finds that they caused reporting violations by the company based on their roles in accounting for $400 million paid to the company by Bertelsmann AG in two sets of transactions. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Our complaint against AOL Time Warner details a wide array of wrongdoing, including fraudulent round-trip transactions to inflate online advertising revenues, fraudulent inflation of AOL subscriber numbers, misapplication of accounting principles relating to AOL Europe, and participation in frauds against the shareholders of three other companies. Some of the misconduct occurred while the ink on a prior Commission cease-and-desist order was barely dry. Such an institutional failure calls for strong sanctions."" James T. Coffman, Assistant Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Accountants are gatekeepers to the capital markets. The actions against Pace, Barge, and Desroches demonstrate that the Commission will hold responsible executives and accountants who fail to take meaningful action when faced with significant evidence that the accounting is wrong. As our investigation continues, we will be turning our attention to those primarily responsible for the company's fraud and improper reporting."" The Commission's complaint against Time Warner, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations: Beginning in mid-2000, stock prices of Internet-related businesses declined precipitously as, among other things, sales of online advertising declined and the rate of growth of new online subscriptions started to flatten. Beginning at this time, and extending through 2002, the company employed fraudulent round-trip transactions that boosted its online advertising revenue to mask the fact that it also experienced a business slow-down. The round-trip transactions ranged in complexity and sophistication, but in each instance the company effectively funded its own online advertising revenue by giving the counterparties the means to pay for advertising that they would not otherwise have purchased. To conceal the true nature of the transactions, the company typically structured and documented round-trips as if they were two or more separate, bona fide transactions, conducted at arm's length and reflecting each party's independent business purpose. The company delivered mostly untargeted, less desirable, remnant online advertising to the round-trip advertisers, and the round-trip advertisers often had little or no ability to control the quantity, quality, and sometimes even the content of the online advertising they received. Because the round-trip customers effectively were paying for the online advertising with the company's funds, the customers seldom, if ever, complained. Several of the counterparties to the round-trip transactions were publicly traded companies. Three of these counterparties-Homestore, Inc., PurchasePro.com, Inc., and a California software company- improperly recognized revenue on the round-trip transactions and reported materially misstated financial results to their own investors. As a consequence, the company aided and abetted the frauds of three public companies. The company artificially inflated the number of AOL subscribers in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2001 so it could report to the investment community that it had met its new subscriber targets, an important metric the market used to evaluate AOL (both before and after its merger with Time Warner). Specifically, the company counted members from ""bulk subscription sales"" to corporate customers (for distribution to their employees) when the company knew that the memberships had not, and mostly would not, be activated. In at least one instance, the company entered into round-trip arrangements to fund the corporate customers' purchases of bulk subscriptions. Additionally, in last-minute efforts to meet the quarterly targets, the company on at least four occasions shipped non-conforming bulk subscription membership kits to the customers prior to quarter-end with the understanding that it would turn around and replace them at a later date with conforming kits, but it nonetheless counted new subscribers from these sales as of the quarter-end. From March 2000 through January 2002, the company failed to properly consolidate the financial results of AOL Europe in its financial statements. AOL Europe was originally a 50/50 joint venture between AOL and Bertelsmann. In March 2000, AOL entered into a contingent purchase agreement relating to Bertelsmann's interest in AOL Europe. The agreement gave AOL broad and direct powers enabling it to control the operations and assets of AOL Europe, a fact that the company acknowledged in a letter to the European Commission (in the context of satisfying EC merger regulations). GAAP requires consolidation when one entity has a controlling financial interest in another entity. The company's failure to properly consolidate AOL Europe resulted in material misstatements of its financial results, including overstatements of operating income and free cash flow in 2000 and 2001, overstatements of net income in 2000, understatements of net losses in 2001, and understatements of total debt in 2000 and 2001. The Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against AOL on May 15, 2000 because AOL violated reporting and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws. Thereafter, the company violated the cease-and-desist order by artificially inflating its online advertising revenue and the number of AOL subscribers, as well as its failure to consolidate AOL Europe's financial statements. The Commission's cease-and-desist order against Pace, Barge, and Desroches addresses their roles in accounting for transactions with Bertelsmann. In 2001 and 2002, the company inflated its online advertising revenue by $400 million in connection with transactions with Bertelsmann. In substance, Bertelsmann paid $400 million as consideration for amendments to the multi-billion-dollar contingent purchase agreement governing the company's purchase of Bertelsmann's interest in AOL Europe. The contract amendments had substantial value, and Bertelsmann offered to compensate the company for the amendments. Rather than accept cash in exchange for the amendments, however, the company requested that Bertelsmann purchase advertising in the aggregate amount of $400 million. The company then improperly and materially inflated its online advertising revenues by recognizing the $400 million as advertising revenue rather than as consideration received for amending the AOL Europe purchase agreement. Pace, Barge, and Desroches were corporate-level finance and accounting executives at the company who were responsible for, among other things, reviewing and approving the accounting treatment recommended by the company's business units. In this role, they approved the company's accounting for the $400 million as advertising revenue. In doing so, they based their accounting decisions on the form of the transactions and oral and written representations, some of which were false and omitted material facts, by other company employees. They failed to pursue facts and circumstances that evidenced the true economic substance of the transactions. As a result, although others were responsible for negotiating the $400 million transactions, Pace, Barge, and Desroches each were a cause of the company's improperly accounting for the $400 million in annual and periodic reports filed with the Commission. The Commission's investigation into these matters continues.

294,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it instituted and simultaneously settled an enforcement action against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (CGMI) for failing to provide customers with important information relating to their purchases of mutual fund shares. The case against CGMI arises out of a broader investigation into mutual fund sales practices. It involves two distinct disclosure failures at CGMI, which offered retail brokerage services under the Smith Barney trade name. First, CGMI failed to fully disclose to its customers material information regarding its revenue sharing program, known as the Tier Program. Under the Tier Program, approximately 75 mutual fund complexes made revenue sharing payments to CGMI in exchange for access to or ""shelf space"" within CGMI's retail brokerage network. In fact, CGMI offered and sold only the funds of those mutual fund complexes that participated in the Tier Program. CGMI also provided additional benefits to the mutual fund complexes that made higher revenue sharing payments. These benefits included increased access to branch offices, greater agenda space at sales meetings, and visibility in CGMI's in-house publications and broadcasts. This practice created a conflict of interest that CGMI failed to adequately disclose to its customers. The second disclosure failure relates to CGMI's sale of Class B shares of mutual funds in amounts aggregating $50,000 or greater. CGMI recommended and sold Class B shares of mutual funds to certain customers who, depending on the amount of the investment and the holding period, generally would have obtained a higher overall rate of return had they purchased Class A shares instead. These customers could have benefited had they purchased Class A shares because they could have qualified for breakpoints beginning at the $50,000 level. In addition, as a result of the customers' purchases of Class B shares, CGMI received greater commissions than it would have earned had it sold Class A shares of the same mutual funds. However, CGMI's financial consultants, when recommending and selling Class B shares of mutual fund shares to customers, did not adequately disclose that: (i) such shares were subject to higher annual fees that could have a negative impact on the customers' investment return, or (ii) once breakpoints become available beginning at the $50,000 level, an equal investment in Class A shares could yield a higher return. The Commission's Order finds that this conduct violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 17(a)(2) prohibits the making of materially misleading statements or omissions in the offer and sale of securities. Rule 10b-10 requires broker-dealers to disclose the source and amount of any remuneration received from third parties in connection with a securities transaction. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said: ""We hope securities industry professionals have by now received the message that they must fully inform their customers of the nature and extent of any conflicts of interest that may affect their recommendations."" ""CGMI, like many in the securities industry, was recommending Class B shares to certain customers without explaining that, in many cases, they could have paid less and had the prospect of better returns had they purchased Class A shares, instead,"" said Arthur S. Gabinet, District Administrator of the Commission's Philadelphia District Office. ""While firms are entitled to fair compensation for their services, this sales practice was particularly troublesome because the firm's excess financial rewards came at the customers' direct expense without a full and fair explanation."" CGMI has consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying the finding contained therein. The Order: (i) imposes a censure against CGMI; (ii) requires CGMI to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act; (iii) imposes a $20 million civil penalty against CGMI; and (iv) requires CGMI to comply with certain undertakings. As part of those undertakings, CGMI will retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of CGMI's mutual fund sales practices. In addition, CGMI will offer affected customers the option of converting their Class B shares into Class A shares in such a manner that each customer is placed in the same financial position, based on actual fund performance, in which such customer would have been had the customer purchased Class A shares instead of Class B shares. The staff coordinated its investigation with the NASD, which is bringing a separate enforcement action against CGMI for its sales of Class B shares.

295,"-The Commission today charged Flowserve Corporation, a manufacturer of precision-engineered flow control equipment headquartered in Irving, Texas, with violating Regulation FD and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Regulation FD prohibits issuers from selectively disclosing material nonpublic information to certain persons -- securities analysts, broker-dealers, investment advisers and institutional investors -- before disclosing the same information to the public. The SEC also charged its Chief Executive Officer, C. Scott Greer, and Director of Investor Relations, Michael Conley, with causing FlowserveÂs violations. The Commission issued an Order that found Flowserve violated Regulation FD when, in a private meeting with analysts near the end of a reporting period, the company reaffirmed its previous earnings guidance. Without admitting or denying the CommissionÂs allegations and findings, Flowserve and Greer consented to the entry of a final judgment by the federal court that would require them to pay civil penalties of $350,000 and $50,000 respectively. Flowserve, Greer and Conley also consented to the CommissionÂs issuance of a cease-and-desist order. This is the first Regulation FD case filed by the Commission involving a reaffirmation of earnings by an issuer and the first settled enforcement action against a Director of Investor Relations for violating this rule. ÂIssuers cannot pick and choose the recipients of material information,Â said Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of the SECÂs Division of Enforcement. ÂIf issuers disclose material information to market professionals, then Regulation FD requires that they disseminate the same information to the marketplace.Â In its Order, the Commission found that, Flowserve, a calendar-year reporting corporation, began 2002 forecasting annual earnings per share in the range of $1.90 to $2.30. In July of that year, the Company revised that estimate to $1.70 to $1.90 per share. On Sept. 27, the Company lowered its earnings estimate to $1.45 to $1.55 per share, which the Company reaffirmed in its Form 10-Q filed on Oct. 22, 2002. The $1.45 to $1.55 range represented more than a 30% decline in earnings per share estimates since the beginning of the year. On Nov. 19, 2002, forty-two days before the end of FlowserveÂs fiscal year, Greer, along with Conley, met privately in Irving, Texas with analysts. At that meeting, one of the analysts asked about the CompanyÂs earnings guidance for the year. Neither Conley nor Greer gave the response required by the CompanyÂs policy, i.e., that earnings guidance was effective at the date given and would not be updated until the Company publicly announced updated guidance. Conley did not caution Greer before Greer answered the analystÂs questions. In fact, Conley remained altogether silent. Instead, in response to the question, Greer reaffirmed the previous public guidance, which had been issued on Oct. 22, 2002, and thus provided additional material nonpublic information. On Nov. 20, 2002, an analyst who attended the meeting issued a report stating that Flowserve had reaffirmed its earnings guidance. The next day, on Nov. 21, FlowserveÂs closing stock price was approximately 6% higher than the closing price the day before. In addition, the trading volume of FlowserveÂs stock increased by 75%, from 379,500 shares traded on Nov. 20 to 658,300 shares traded on Nov. 21. After the market closed on Nov. 21, Flowserve furnished a Form 8-K to the Commission acknowledging that it had Âreaffirmed its full year 2002 estimated earnings per share.Â In addition to the underlying conduct, the Commission considered the RespondentsÂ lack of cooperation afforded the Commission staff. Specifically, and inconsistent with the Form 8-K furnished by the Company, both Greer and Conley denied that a reaffirmation occurred at the private meeting with the analysts.

296,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today instituted and simultaneously settled an enforcement action against the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., finding that the NYSE, over the course of nearly four years, failed to police specialists, who engaged in widespread and unlawful proprietary trading on the floor of the NYSE. The Commission found that the NYSE violated Section 19(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to enforce compliance with the federal securities laws and NYSE rules which prohibit specialists from ""interpositioning"" and ""trading ahead"" of customer orders. In settling this action, the NYSE consented, without admitting or denying the findings, to entry of an order imposing a censure and requiring the NYSE to cease and desist from future violations of the federal securities laws. The NYSE also agreed to several significant remedial measures designed to strengthen the NYSE's oversight of specialists and other floor members. The NYSE agreed to an undertaking of $20 million to fund regulatory audits of the NYSE's regulatory program every two years through the year 2011. The NYSE has also agreed to implement a pilot program for video and audio surveillance on its trading floor for at least an eighteen-month period. Stephen M. Cutler, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Self-Regulatory Organizations like the New York Stock Exchange have been a critical part of the regulatory landscape for almost a century now. When SROs don't vigorously police and prosecute wrongdoing in their markets, investors suffer. As our investigation continues, we will be focusing on individuals who may have fallen down on the job and contributed to the failure that resulted in the case we bring today."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, added, ""This settlement is about protecting investors. The relief we have obtained in this action will raise the bar for regulation at the NYSE and help prevent misconduct on the NYSE floor from going undetected again. The video and audio surveillance will help the NYSE keep a watchful eye on the specialists, and the regulatory auditor will keep a watchful eye on the NYSE's performance as a regulator."" Specifically, the Commission's Order finds that from 1999 through 2003, various NYSE specialists repeatedly engaged in unlawful proprietary trading, resulting in more than $158 million of customer harm. The improper trading took various forms, including ""interpositioning"" the firms' dealer accounts between customer orders and ""trading ahead"" for their dealer accounts in front of executable agency orders on the same side of the market. From 1999 through almost all of 2002, the NYSE failed to adequately monitor and police specialist trading activity, allowing the vast majority of this unlawful conduct to continue. The illegal trading went largely undetected because the NYSE's regulatory program was deficient in surveilling, investigating and disciplining the specialists' trading violations. Specifically, the NYSE failed in 3 primary areas. The NYSE Failed to Adequately Surveil for Trading Ahead and Interpositioning Violations: The NYSE established and relied on an overbroad surveillance system for trading ahead, which captured only a small fraction of violations. Despite advice by the NYSE's internal audit group and other indications that the surveillance was inadequate to detect the full extent of trading ahead, the NYSE failed to make necessary adjustments to the surveillance parameters. The NYSE Failed to Adequately Investigate Trading Ahead and Interpositioning Violations: Although the NYSE's existing surveillance parameters were designed to capture only the most egregious instances of trading ahead and interpositioning, the surveillance unit responsible for reviewing the alerts routinely ignored scores of likely violations. When the surveillance unit made referrals to the NYSE's investigative unit, investigators failed to investigate the full extent of the misconduct. The NYSE Failed to Appropriately Discipline Trading Ahead and Interpositioning Violations: Despite compelling evidence of misconduct, the NYSE routinely failed to take disciplinary action or imposed only the most minor of sanctions. The Commission's Order finds that the NYSE violated Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act by failing to enforce compliance with the federal securities laws and NYSE rules that prohibit unlawful proprietary trading by specialists â specifically, Section 11(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 11b-1 thereunder, and NYSE Rules 92 and 104.10. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the NYSE has agreed to a censure, an order to cease and desist from further violations of Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act, and to implement certain remedial undertakings, including: Retention of a Regulatory Auditor: The NYSE will set aside a $20 million reserve fund to retain a regulatory auditor to conduct audits of the NYSE's regulatory program every 2 years through 2011. The regulatory auditor will assess whether the NYSE's regulatory policies and procedures are reasonably designed and effective to detect and deter securities laws violations and whether the NYSE's regulatory group is in compliance with its policies and procedures. Implementation of a Pilot Audio and Video Surveillance System: The pilot program will be conducted over an eighteen month period and involve at least 20 NYSE stocks. Following an independent evaluation of the pilot program, the Commission will determine whether to modify, eliminate, or expand the program to the entire NYSE trading floor. Other significant undertakings include: (i) systems and procedures to track the identity of specialists and clerks trading on the NYSE floor; (ii) enhancements to the NYSE's electronic trading systems to prevent specialists from engaging in trading ahead and interpositioning; (iii) enhancements to the NYSE's referral process and the training of its regulatory staff; and (iv) certification by the NYSE's Chief Regulatory Officer every year for a period of 5 years that the NYSE is in compliance with the Commission's Order. This failure by the NYSE to police trading ahead and interpositioning by specialists follows on the heels of a regulatory failure by the NYSE in the late 1990s involving independent floor brokers, which was addressed by the Commission in an order against the NYSE in June 1999. See In the Matter of New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Release No. 34-41574 (June 29, 1999).

299,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Guillaume Pollet, a former managing director of SG Cowen & Co., with insider trading and fraud by short selling the stock of companies prior to the companies closing on a private offering of stock, including offerings in which SG Cowen invested. The private offerings are often referred to as ""PIPEs"" for ""private investment in public equity."" At the time of the misconduct, Pollet was in charge of investing SG Cowen proprietary funds in PIPE transactions. The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that during 2001 Pollet traded in the shares of ten public companies that either engaged in, or were contemplating engaging in, PIPE financings after receiving confidential non-public information about the upcoming PIPE transaction. Specifically, Pollet routinely sold short the publicly traded securities of these PIPE issuers prior to the close of the PIPE transaction in order to lock in gains for SG Cowen's proprietary account. As a result of Pollet's illicit trading, SG Cowen locked in over $4 million in trading profits, in addition to other gains SG Cowen made on the transactions. In several instances, SG Cowen also acted as the PIPE issuer's investment banker. The Commission's complaint also alleges that, in several instances, Pollet's short selling was directly contrary to representations that SG Cowen made to PIPE issuers in connection with the PIPE transactions. For example, SG Cowen specifically represented to some of the PIPE issuers that SG Cowen would not short sell the securities of such issuer prior to the close of the PIPE transaction. SG Cowen also represented to each of the PIPE issuers that it was acquiring the PIPE securities with investment intent. SG Cowen made these representations at a time when Pollet had already started to short sell the securities of these PIPE issuers. Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""While PIPE transactions may help a company meet its financing needs, they also create opportunities for fraud. This case sends the message that we will actively patrol this area so that issuers and investors alike can have confidence in these financing vehicles."" David Rosenfeld, Associate Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, added: ""Individuals who receive confidential information about important financing transactions must refrain from trading based on that information. This case was particularly egregious because there were specific representations made to the PIPE issuers that SG Cowen would not or had not engaged in short selling prior to the close of the transaction."" The complaint alleges that through his fraudulent trading Pollet violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties.

303,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today issued an Order instituting public administrative proceedings against Deloitte & Touche LLP based upon its failed audit in 1999 of the fiscal 1998 financial statements of Just for Feet, Inc., a now-defunct shoe and sports apparel retailer once headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, for which the firm received audit fees of approximately $361,000. The engagement partner, Steven H. Barry, CPA, and the audit manager, Karen T. Baker, CPA, were also charged. Without admitting or denying the Order's findings, Deloitte agreed to accept a censure and pay $375,000 to settle the charges, while Barry and Baker each consented to a denial of the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. They can apply for reinstatement after two years and one year, respectively. Richard P. Wessel, District Administrator of the Commission's Atlanta District Office, said, ""Auditing firms and their personnel are responsible for exercising professional care and maintaining skepticism in auditing financial statements, particularly when the company is identified as having a high risk of potential fraud."" Katherine S. Addleman, Associate Director for Enforcement in the Atlanta District Office, stated, ""Shareholders depend on auditing firms as a check on the honesty of management. They are expected to respond appropriately to wrongdoing, adequately test the claims made by management and complete the work supporting the audit before issuing an audit report."" The Order finds that Deloitte formerly served as the auditing firm for Just for Feet and assigned Barry and Baker to serve as the engagement partner and audit manager, respectively, for its audit of the company's 1998 financial statements. Just for Feet falsified its financial statements by (1) improperly recognizing unearned and fictitious receivables and revenue from its vendors, (2) failing to properly account for excess, worthless and obsolete inventory and to disclose problems with excess inventory, and (3) improperly recording as income the value of display booths provided by its vendors. These fraudulent financial statements were included in the company's annual report for fiscal 1998 and in two registration statements for the offering of securities filed with the Commission in 1999. The Order finds that Deloitte, Barry and Baker reasonably should have known that Just for Feet's 1998 financial statements had not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Order further finds that Deloitte, Barry and Baker did not comply with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) in the conduct of their audit and engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice through repeated instances of unreasonable conduct. Specifically, the Order finds that Deloitte, Barry and Baker did not respond adequately to indications that the company was recognizing unearned and fraudulent vendor allowances as income. The Order also cited Deloitte, Barry and Baker for failing to test adequately the company's reserve for obsolete or excess inventory and failing to respond adequately to indications that Just for Feet was fraudulently increasing its income through fictitious purchases of display booths from its vendors. The Order also finds that Deloitte's National Risk Management Program identified Just for Feet as a high-risk client, but Deloitte did not carry out the responsibilities required by such a designation. The Order censures Deloitte pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Deloitte agreed to pay $375,000, to the U.S. Treasury. The Order further notes that, in determining to accept Deloitte's offer, the Commission considered Deloitte's willingness to undertake measures to address deficiencies in its National Risk Management Program as detailed in another order issued simultaneously concerning Deloitte's audit of the financial statements of Adelphia Communications Corporation. The Order also denies Barry and Baker the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants with a right to apply for reinstatement, with respect to Barry, in two years, and, with respect to Baker, in one year.

304,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has instituted settled enforcement proceedings against Tyson Foods, Inc. and its former Chairman and CEO Donald ""Don"" Tyson. The SEC charged that in proxy statements filed with the Commission from 1997 to 2003, Tyson Foods made misleading disclosures of perquisites and personal benefits provided to Don Tyson both prior to and after his retirement as senior chairman in October 2001. The SEC also charged the company with failing to maintain adequate internal controls over Don Tyson's personal use of company assets. Don Tyson was separately charged with causing and aiding and abetting the company's disclosure violations. Both parties agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment in a civil action filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that orders Tyson Foods to pay a $1.5 million penalty and orders Don Tyson to pay a $700,000 penalty. In addition, both parties separately consented to the entry of an SEC Order that orders them to cease and desist from violating the proxy solicitation and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. The Order also orders Tyson Foods to cease and desist from violating the internal controls provisions of the securities laws. The company and Don Tyson agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the findings or allegations in the SEC's Order and complaint. ""Shareholders have a right to complete and accurate disclosures that provide a full appreciation of how public companies are using corporate assets for the personal benefit of their top executives,"" said Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Full and complete proxy disclosures enhance shareholders' ability to assess how well directors are representing their interests."" The SEC's Order finds that while Don Tyson was employed as senior chairman from 1997 to 2001, the company provided approximately $3 million of perquisites and personal benefits to him, his wife, his daughters and three individuals with whom he had close personal relationships. The Order finds that Don Tyson caused disclosure failures with respect to many of these perquisites because his responses to director and officer questionnaires were inadequate. The Order also finds that many of those perquisites had not been raised with or authorized by the company's compensation committee. According to the Order, the $3 million in perquisites included The Order further finds that in its proxy statements filed for 1997 to 2001, the company: In addition, according to the Order, the company's 2002 and 2003 proxy statements used the same misleading terms ""travel and entertainment"" to describe the continuation of Don Tyson's perquisites pursuant to an October 2001 retirement agreement with the company and failed to disclose fully the nature and scope of those benefits. The SEC also finds and alleges that due to internal control failures at Tyson Foods throughout most of 1997 to 2003, many of the perquisites described above (totaling approximately $1.5 million) were neither raised with nor authorized by the company's compensation committee or its board of directors. Thus, for example, the board members were unaware until the SEC's investigation that the company was paying for substantial personal expenses incurred by Don Tyson and two of his friends or that Don Tyson's family and friends regularly used the company aircraft while he was not on board. Nor was the board aware until November 2002, as a result of an internal company review of perquisites, of the housekeeping, lawn maintenance, telephone services and automobile maintenance provided to Don Tyson and his family and friends. Finally, the SEC finds and alleges that Don Tyson, who signed the company's annual reports that incorporated the proxy statements for each fiscal year from 1997 to 2003, caused and aided and abetted the company's disclosure failures. In each year from 1997 to 2003, he signed director and officer questionnaires used to prepare the company's proxy statements that failed to identify or quantify various perquisites. Before signing them, he failed to read the questionnaires or take action to ensure the accuracy of the company's disclosure of his perquisites even though he was the only individual who possessed certain information necessary to accurately complete the questionnaires. In addition, he provided the company an incomplete list of perquisites that he had received for 2002, which omitted the fact that the company had paid for personal expenses for him and two of his friends and had provided housekeeping, lawn maintenance, automobile maintenance and telephone services to him and his family and friends. As a result of these and other findings, the SEC's Order finds that Tyson Foods violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, and orders the company to cease and desist from committing any violations and any future violations of these statutory provisions and rules. The SEC's Order also finds that Don Tyson caused the company's violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, and orders Don Tyson to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of the foregoing statutory provisions and rules.

305,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of civil charges against two voicemail broadcasters and their associates for broadcasting hundreds of thousands of fraudulent ""wrong number"" stock tip messages. The messages, which were left on telephone voicemail recording machines throughout the country, were designed to make each recipient believe the caller had dialed the number by mistake. Many of the messages were left by a woman calling herself ""Debbie,"" and sounded as if she had misdialed when calling a friend to pass along a hot stock tip. The SEC filed a complaint in the District of Columbia that charges Michael O'Grady and two affiliated Augusta, Ga.-based telemarketing companies, Telephone Broadcast Company, LLC and Telephony Leasing Corporation, LLC, with broadcasting ""wrong number"" touts of at least six microcap stocks. The complaint alleges that the messages were part of a larger scheme enabling Houston-based stock promoters to sell approximately $4.5 million of one of the touted stocks through a Tampa, Fla.-based broker-dealer. The scheme drove up the price of each of the touted stocks, temporarily inflating their combined market capitalization by approximately $179 million. In a separate complaint, the SEC charged David E. Whittemore of Dallas, Texas, and his privately-held corporation Whittemore Management, Inc., with broadcasting hundreds of thousands of similar fraudulent ""wrong number"" voicemail messages in a copycat scheme involving two microcap stocks. Also charged in that complaint were Peter S. Cahill of Houston, Texas, and Clearlake Venture Group, an entity Cahill controls. ""This 'wrong number' scam is the first of its kind to hit the microcap market and it generated more complaints from the public than any other microcap fraud in recent memory,"" noted Peter H. Bresnan, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. ""The cases filed today demonstrate that even when fraudsters are resourceful and inventive in misusing new technologies, the Commission can be equally resourceful and inventive when it comes to tracking them down and stopping them."" ""These actions are a clear signal that the Commission is fully committed to the vigorous prosecution of those involved in the manipulation of the microcap market,"" commented John Reed Stark, Chief of the SEC's Office of Internet Enforcement. ""Those who harm investors through greed-driven frauds like this 'vicemail' scheme will be found, and they will be punished."" Without admitting or denying the allegations made by the Commission, O'Grady consented to a final judgment ordering him to pay $50,786 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $25,000 penalty. In addition, O'Grady and his companies consented to being permanently enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's action against O'Grady was brought contemporaneously with a related action by the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia in which O'Grady pled guilty to one count of a criminal information charging him with obstruction of justice. The SEC's complaint against O'Grady alleges that he was paid for broadcasting the messages in cash taken from a blue duffel bag during a trip to a Gulfport, Miss., casino and that he also used his knowledge of the campaign to profit by trading in three of the touted stocks. The complaint also alleges that ""Debbie"" is the wife of an Altamonte Springs, Fla.-based promoter who hired O'Grady and his companies to broadcast the messages. In the actions against Whittemore, WMI, Cahill and Clearlake, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties based on the defendants' alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Whittemore and WMI's alleged aiding and abetting of those violations. The SEC alleges that Cahill and Clearlake hired Whittemore to broadcast messages touting one of the companies. According to the complaint, Whittemore received cash and stock payments for broadcasting the messages while Cahill sold approximately 680,000 shares of one of the touted stocks while the messages were being broadcast, generating proceeds of $508,000. The Commission first cautioned the public about these and similar messages touting small, thinly traded stocks, commonly known as ""microcap"" stocks, in an August 2004 Investor Alert, after which O'Grady and his companies stopped broadcasting the messages. The Commission would like to acknowledge the assistance of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, the Washington Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, NASD, the Division of Securities of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, and the many members of the public who responded to the Commission's Investor Alert by sending in information about the ""wrong number"" messages they had received.

306,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today instituted a settled enforcement action against the National Stock Exchange (NSX) for its failure to enforce compliance by NSX dealers with certain exchange rules from 1997 through 2003. At the same time, the SEC instituted a settled administrative proceeding and civil action against NSXâs president and chief executive officer, David Colker, for his failure to enforce compliance with an NSX rule. Specifically, the SEC found that NSX violated Section 19(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by failing until 2004 to conduct surveillance for violations of its customer priority rule, an important investor protection that prohibited NSX dealers from trading securities for their own accounts ahead of marketable customer orders. As a result, NSX failed to detect hundreds of thousands of transactions in which NSX dealers traded ahead of customer orders. The SEC also found that NSX and Colker did not enforce NSXâs market order exposure (MOE) rule in a manner consistent with the ruleâs language. The MOE rule required NSX dealers to provide customer market orders with the opportunity for price improvement whenever the spread between the national best bid and offer was greater than the minimum price variation. In 1997, when the minimum price variation decreased from 1/8 to 1/16 of a point, NSX continued enforcing the rule at spreads of 1/4 point or greater instead of at 1/8 point or greater. At Colkerâs direction, NSX did not file a proposed rule amendment with the SEC seeking approval for its limited enforcement of the MOE rule, although NSX was required to do so. Colker made this decision, in part, because he wanted to avoid exposing a proposed rule amendment to a public notice-and-comment process. Consequently, public customers lost opportunities for potential price improvement on thousands of market orders executed on NSX from 1997 to 2003. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement, said, âSelf-regulatory organizations must vigorously enforce their own rules and the federal securities laws. This settlement will further safeguard investors by strengthening NSXâs regulatory functions.â Antonia Chion, an Associate Director of Enforcement, added, âSROs and their senior management must be scrupulous in ensuring that business concerns do not interfere with their regulatory obligations and judgment.â As part of the settlement, NSX, without admitting or denying the findings in the SECâs Order, consented to a censure, an order to cease and desist from future violations of certain rule-filing, record-keeping, and other SRO provisions of the federal securities laws, and an order to undertake substantial remedial measures to bolster its regulatory and governance functions. In particular, NSX agreed to separate its regulatory functions from its business functions by, among other things, appointing an independent chief regulatory officer to supervise NSXâs day-to-day regulatory affairs. NSX also agreed to implement automated daily surveillance for potential violations of several NSX and Exchange Act order-handling rules, and to earmark $1 million for two separate regulatory audits of NSXâs surveillance, examination, investigation, and disciplinary programs over a three-year period. Colker consented, without admitting or denying the findings in the SECâs Order and Complaint, to the imposition of a censure and, subject to court approval, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordering him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty. Under the terms of the SECâs Order, Colker and his successors will have no future role in NSXâs regulatory functions.

307,"The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed securities fraud charges against Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., Alberto William Vilar and Gary Alan Tanaka, Amerindoâs co-founders and principals, for misappropriating at least $5 million from an Amerindo client. Amerindo is a registered investment adviser with offices in San Francisco, New York and London. The Commissionâs complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendantsâ ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, upon emergency motion by the Commission, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Amerindo prohibiting it from future violations of the federal securities laws and appointed a temporary monitor over Amerindo. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that in approximately June 2002, Vilar solicited an Amerindo client and close personal friend to invest $5 million in the Amerindo Venture Fund LP, a limited partnership that was purportedly being organized to qualify and be operated as a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC). Shortly after the investor wired $5 million to a brokerage account as Amerindo had instructed, Tanaka began to transfer a portion of the investorâs funds to other accounts Vilar and Amerindo controlled. Specifically, within several days of the investorâs investment, Tanaka signed letters of authorization directing the transfer of at least $1.65 million to other accounts, including $1 million to a personal checking account held in Vilarâs name, and $650,000 to a bank account Amerindo controlled. Vilar then used the funds he received from the investor to pay personal expenses, including transferring $540,000 to Washington and Jefferson College, his alma mater to which he had pledged large sums, and $177,000 to the American Academy in Berlin, an institution to which Vilar had donated money in the past.

308,"The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed securities fraud charges against Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., Alberto William Vilar and Gary Alan Tanaka, Amerindoâs co-founders and principals, for misappropriating at least $5 million from an Amerindo client. Amerindo is a registered investment adviser with offices in San Francisco, New York and London. The Commissionâs complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendantsâ ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, upon emergency motion by the Commission, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Amerindo prohibiting it from future violations of the federal securities laws and appointed a temporary monitor over Amerindo. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that in approximately June 2002, Vilar solicited an Amerindo client and close personal friend to invest $5 million in the Amerindo Venture Fund LP, a limited partnership that was purportedly being organized to qualify and be operated as a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC). Shortly after the investor wired $5 million to a brokerage account as Amerindo had instructed, Tanaka began to transfer a portion of the investorâs funds to other accounts Vilar and Amerindo controlled.

310,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed an enforcement action against John Houldsworth, a former senior executive of General Re Corporation, for his role in aiding and abetting American International Group, Inc. in committing securities fraud. In its complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the Commission alleged that Houldsworth and others helped AIG structure two sham reinsurance transactions that had as their only purpose to allow AIG to add a total of $500 million in phony loss reserves to its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. The transactions were initiated by AIG to quell criticism by analysts concerning a reduction in the company's loss reserves in the third quarter of 2000. In partial settlement of the Commission's claims, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Houldsworth consented to the entry of a partial final judgment which resolves all issues of liability against him but defers the determination of disgorgement and penalties until a later date. As part of his settlement, Houldsworth has agreed to cooperate fully with the Commission in its continuing investigation of this matter. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said: ""AIG's fraud did not occur in isolation. With this case, we are holding accountable an individual who, even though outside AIG, knowingly assisted the company to manipulate its financial results."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""This is another step in our ongoing investigation of the abuse of insurance and reinsurance to falsify a company's financial results. Here the defendant helped to structure a sham transaction designed solely to enable AIG to achieve a specific, and false, accounting result."" In its complaint against Houldsworth, the Commission alleges that Houldsworth and others at Gen Re worked with their counterparts at AIG to fashion two sham reinsurance contracts between Cologne Re Dublin, a Gen Re subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, of which Houldsworth was the Chief Executive Officer, and an AIG subsidiary. The complaint details the conversations of participants in the planning meeting and other conversations that led to AIG's filing of fraudulent financial statements. On the basis of these conversations and other facts alleged, the complaint charges that all parties understood from the beginning that they were engaged in an undertaking to create sham transaction documents for the sole purpose of allowing AIG to make false accounting entries on its books. As Houldsworth and others at Gen Re knew, AIG accounted for the sham transactions as if they were real reinsurance contracts that transferred risk from Gen Re to AIG, when all parties involved knew that was not true. As a result of AIG's accounting treatment for these transactions, the company's financial results showed false increases in reserves that AIG touted in the company's quarterly earnings releases for the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. Without the phony loss reserves, AIG's financial results in both quarters would have shown further declines in its loss reserves. In a press release dated March 30, 2005, AIG admitted that the accounting for these transactions was improper and would be corrected. In its 2004 Form 10-K filed with the Commission on May 31, 2005, AIG restated its financial statements to recharacterize the transactions as deposits rather than as reinsurance. The Commission's complaint charges Houldsworth with aiding and abetting the violations by AIG and others of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Houldsworth, in addition to undertaking to cooperate fully with the Commission, consented to the entry of a partial final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and deferring the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date. In addition, Houldsworth has agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, barring him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.

The Commission issued an order that finds that Ford Credit, a company wholly owned by Ford Motor Company, publicly distributed sales materials soliciting investment in the ""Ford Money Market Account"" that did not satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act. In sales materials for its so-called ""Ford Money Market Account,"" Ford Credit promoted the accounts as comparable to a traditional money market investment. Ford Credit's sales materials emphasized that the accounts paid a guaranteed interest rate slightly higher than the average rate paid by money market accounts and highlighted features of the investment typically present in checking and money market accounts offered by banks or mutual funds. However, many of Ford Credit's sales materials may have created confusion among investors by Although prior to investing investors ultimately received a prospectus setting forth the important disclosures outlined above, each of the sales materials was a ""prospectus"" that did not satisfy the informational requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act.

314,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of civil charges against Terryâs Tips, Inc., a Vermont corporation, and Terry F. Allen, of Ferrisburg, Vt., for violations related to their operation of âauto-tradingâ programs. The Commission alleges that Terryâs Tips and Allen used misleading performance projections in marketing the auto-trading programs to clients. The SEC also issued an Investor Alert, âAll About Auto-Trading,â which lists the steps investors should take to thoroughly check out any auto-trading program before they hand over access to their accounts and hard-earned dollars. The alert explains auto-trading, arms investors with questions to ask, and provides time-tested tips for avoiding costly mistakes. âThe filing of this case illustrates once again that an investor should exercise care and appropriate skepticism before giving another person authority to direct trading in his account, particularly where that person claims to provide unrealistically high returns to the investor,â noted Ken Israel, District Administrator of the Commissionâs Salt Lake District Office. Auto-trading is a relatively new, but rapidly spreading, investment vehicle in which subscribers to online investment newsletters open designated auto-trading accounts at brokerage firms selected by the newsletters. The auto-trading clients sign an agreement with the brokerage firm giving the online adviser authority to automatically direct trades in the clientâs personal brokerage account. Auto-trading services are typically offered as an additional service provided by publishers of online financial newsletters. The financial newsletters usually require subscribers to pay a fee to auto-trade in addition to the subscription fee paid to receive the general newsletter. Once the brokerage account is established, the online adviser sends specific trading instructions directly by e-mail or facsimile to the broker-dealer. These instructions are timed to take advantage of market events, and the client learns of the trades only after they have been executed by the broker. The complaint filed in the District of Vermont alleges that Terryâs Tips and Allen have had more than 1200 clients who have invested through its auto-trading programs. The complaint also charges that Terryâs Tips and Allen published performance projections in which they stated subscribers could expect annualized returns of 100% by following Allenâs trading strategies, while at the same time portfolios following these strategies were actually experiencing substantial losses. In this action, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties based on violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

315,"In an emergency federal court action filed today, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a Temporary Restraining Order against Sonja Anticevic, a Croatian national and resident. The Commission alleges that a securities account in Anticevic's name engaged in a series of highly suspicious, and highly profitable, trades in ""out of the money"" call options of Reebok International Ltd. just prior to Reebok's Aug. 3, 2005, announcement that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG. The Commission's complaint alleges that on Aug. 1 and 2, 2005, the Anticevic account purchased a total of at least 1,997 ""out of the money"" call option contracts for the common stock of Reebok. Following the acquisition announcement on Aug. 3, 2005, the price of Reebok's common stock rose more than 30 percent from its closing price the prior day. The Anticevic account sold all of the call options after the price rise, realizing profits of over $2.04 million. Also on August 3, shortly after the sale of the options contracts, the brokerage firm received a wire instruction request to transfer approximately $870,000 of the proceeds from the Reebok trades to a bank account maintained in Salzburg, Austria. Acting on the Commission's request for emergency relief, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the proceeds of the highly suspicious Reebok trades to prevent the movement of those funds outside of the United States. Mark K. Schonfeld, the Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""We responded immediately to an attempt to move ill-gotten funds overseas and beyond the reach of U.S. Courts. We will take swift measures against those who seek to diminish the integrity of our markets."" In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that Anticevic engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

316,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an enforcement action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging former Citigroup executives Thomas W. Jones and Lewis Daidone with fraud relating to Citigroup's creation of an affiliated transfer agent to serve its Smith Barney family of mutual funds at steeply discounted rates. Rather than passing the substantial fee discount on to the mutual funds, Citigroup took most of the benefit of the discount for itself, reaping tens of millions of dollars in profit at the expense of mutual fund shareholders. The actions against the individuals follows the Commission's settlement with the company in May in which Citigroup agreed to pay $208 million that will distributed to victims of the fraud. In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that Jones and Daidone were two of the officers principally responsible for the fraud. The complaint alleges that Jones, the former chief executive officer of the asset management division, directed an effort to negotiate a deal that would permit Citigroup to reap much of the profit that the funds' third party transfer agent had been making. Jones approved the final structure of the deal fully aware that the affiliated transfer agent was projected to make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year for doing minimal work. The complaint further alleges that Jones intentionally or recklessly acted in disregard of his fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure the funds' independent directors were fully informed of the details of the proposal and that Jones approved the presentation delivered to the funds' boards seeking approval of the self-dealing transaction knowing or recklessly disregarding that the presentation was materially misleading. The complaint alleges that Daidone, a senior vice president of the Adviser and the funds' treasurer and chief financial officer, participated in the negotiations with the existing third party transfer agent and was the person responsible for making the presentation to the funds' boards in a way that led the boards to believe the affiliated transfer agent proposal was in the funds' best interests, which was not true. The complaint charges Jones and Daidone with aiding and abetting the Adviser and Global Markets' violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which prohibit registered investment advisers from employing devices, schemes or artifices to defraud clients or prospective clients and from engaging in transactions, practices, or courses of business that operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon clients or prospective clients. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of those provisions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.

The day trader, John J. Amore, is charged with paying brokers at Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch to provide live audio access to those firms' ""squawk boxes"" - devices that broadcast, within a securities firm, institutional orders to buy and sell large blocks of securities. Amore directed traders working for him to listen to the pirated squawk boxes and trade ahead of the institutional orders in order to profit from price movements that resulted from execution of the large customer order. The brokers charged are Ralph D. Casbarro, formerly at Citigroup Global Markets, David G. Ghysels, Jr., formerly at Lehman Brothers, Kenneth E. Mahaffy, Jr., formerly at Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, and Timothy J. O'Connell, formerly at Merrill Lynch. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""These brokers sold day traders real-time access to their firms' confidential information on institutional orders to enable the day traders to profit from the information. Our joint action with the U.S. Attorney's Office sends a clear message that such abuses will not be tolerated."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""These brokers were duty-bound to keep information about large customer orders confidential and to use it to benefit the customer. By using that information for their personal gain, the defendants not only harm the customer, they threaten to undermine the integrity of our markets."" The Commission charged the following individuals: Amore, age 42, a resident of Manhasset, N.Y. From approximately February 2002 to September 2003, Amore was the chief executive officer of Watley Group, a publicly-traded company that was the parent of A.B.Watley, Inc., a registered broker-dealer. Casbarro, age 43, a resident of Bayside, N.Y. From February 1995 to March 2005, Casbarro was employed as a registered representative in a Citigroup office in New York, N.Y. Ghysels, age 47, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla. From March 27, 2001 to March 28, 2003, Ghysels was employed as a registered representative in the Lehman office in Boca Raton, Fla. Mahaffy, age 50, a resident of Huntington, N.Y. From December 1997 to February 2003, Mahaffy was employed as a registered representative at the Merrill Lynch office in Garden City, N.Y., and from February 2003 to June 2005 was employed as a registered representative in the Citigroup office in Melville, N.Y. O'Connell, age 40, a resident of Carle Place, N.Y. From August 1997 through February 2005, O'Connell was employed as a registered representative in Merrill Lynch's office in Garden City, N.Y. The Commission alleges the following: Amore and others at Watley asked Casbarro, Ghysels, Mahaffy, and O'Connell to furnish access to their respective firms' institutional equities squawk boxes. The brokers then placed their telephone receivers next to the squawk boxes and left open phone connections to the Watley office in place for virtually entire trading days. Amore and the proprietary traders at Watley listened for indications on the squawk boxes that firms had received large customer orders and then ""traded ahead"" in the same securities, betting that the prices of the securities would move in response to the subsequent filling of the customer orders. Between at least June 2002 and September 2003, the Watley day traders traded ahead of orders they heard on the Citigroup, Merrill, and Lehman squawk boxes on more than 400 occasions, making gross profits of at least $650,000. The Commission alleges that, in exchange for live audio access to the squawk boxes, Amore, together with others at Watley, compensated the brokers with commission-generating trades. Additionally, Watley traders compensated Casbarro and Mahaffy with secret cash payments. By divulging confidential information concerning customer orders, the brokers breached duties of confidentiality and trust they owed to their employers and to their employers' customers. These brokers also violated their firm's written policies requiring confidential treatment of customer information. The Commission's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, charges the defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, penalties, and an injunction against future violations.

319,"In a second emergency action alleging insider trading in the securities of Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok), the Securities and Exchange Commission today charged eight additional individuals who reaped illegal profits. The Commission has now identified more than $6 million in illicit gains related to the insider trading. The illegal trading took place in domestic and offshore brokerage accounts held by residents of the U.S., Croatia and Germany, the Commission alleged. Acting on the Commission's request, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today issued temporary restraining orders that freeze the proceeds of trading in Reebok securities in the domestic accounts and require the repatriation and freezing of the proceeds in the foreign accounts. Mark K. Schonfeld, the Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""Once again, we have taken immediate action to prevent the dissipation of ill-gotten profits both within and outside the United States. This will preserve the proceeds of the trading pending resolution of this case."" On August 5, the Commission obtained a court order freezing a securities account in the name of Sonja Anticevic, a Croatian national and resident, in which a series of highly profitable and timely trades of ""out of the money"" Reebok call options occurred in the two days prior to an August 3 announcement that Reebok had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG. Today, the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Anticevic which, among other relief, continues the asset freeze. Today, the Commission also filed an amended complaint charging eight other defendants, including Anticevic's nephew, David Pajcin of Clifton, N.J. The amended complaint alleges that Pajcin, a former broker, placed or directed some of the Reebok trades, and tipped other defendants who placed Reebok trades. The Commission also alleges that the defendants acted in concert or under a common direction in placing the Reebok trades, and collectively netted a profit of over $6 million. Also charged were: Henry Siegel, a resident of Pomona, N.Y. Monika Vujovic, a resident of New York, N.Y. Elvis Santana, a resident of Brooklyn, N.Y. Zoran Sormaz , a resident of Zagreb, Croatia. Perica Lopandic, a resident of Reinbek, Germany. Ilija Borac, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia. Certain Unknown Persons trading in an account at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage.at AG. According to the Commission's amended complaint, on August 1 and 2, through four domestic accounts, Anticevic, Siegel, Vujovic, and Santana purchased a total of 4,097 Reebok ""out of the money"" call options. Collectively, these accounts comprised nearly 80% of the buy volume in Reebok call options on those days. All positions in each account were liquidated after the acquisition announcement on August 3. In total, the domestic trading netted profits exceeding $4 million. On those same days, through foreign accounts maintained at the same broker, Anticevic, Sormaz, Lopandic and Borac purchased the equivalent of 145,240 shares of Reebok common stock. Each of those accounts sold all of its Reebok shares on August 3. On August 2, an account maintained at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage, purchased 7,545 shares of Reebok common stock, which were also sold on August 3. Collectively, the proceeds from the foreign trading in Reebok shares was more than $2 million. In addition to the Reebok trading, overlapping trades were placed at the same time in both the domestic and foreign accounts in the securities of other companies. As a result of the defendants' conduct, the Commission alleges that the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

321,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against two former top Kmart executives for misleading investors about Kmart's financial condition in the months preceding the company's bankruptcy. According to the Commission's complaint, former Chief Executive Officer Charles C. Conaway and former Chief Financial Officer John T. McDonald are responsible for materially false and misleading disclosure about the company's liquidity and related matters in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of Kmart's Form 10-Q for the third quarter and nine months ended October 31, 2001, and in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Division of Enforcement, said, ""The SEC has repeatedly emphasized the important role MD&A disclosure is intended to play in giving shareholders the ability to examine a corporation 'through the eyes of management.' Kmart senior management deprived its shareholders of that opportunity."" Peter H. Bresnan, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, stated, ""Investors are entitled to both accurate financial data and an accurate description of the story behind the numbers. Kmart's senior management failed to honestly inform investors that Kmart faced a liquidity crisis in the third quarter of 2001, how the company's own ill-advised action had caused the problem and what steps management took to respond to it."" The Commission alleges that, in the MD&A section, Conaway and McDonald failed to disclose the reasons for a massive inventory overbuy in the summer of 2001 and the impact it had on the company's liquidity. For example, the MD&A disclosure attributed increases in inventory to ""seasonal inventory fluctuations and actions taken to improve our overall in-stock position."" The Commission alleges that this disclosure was materially misleading because, in reality, a significant portion of the inventory buildup was caused by a Kmart officer's reckless and unilateral purchase of $850 million of excess inventory. According to the complaint, the defendants dealt with Kmart's liquidity problems by slowing down payments owed vendors, thereby withholding $570 million from them by the end of the third quarter. According to the complaint, Conaway and McDonald lied about why vendors were not being paid on time and misrepresented the impact that Kmart's liquidity problems had on the company's relationship with its vendors, many of whom stopped shipping product to Kmart during the fall of 2001. Kmart filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 22, 2002. The Commission's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Conaway and McDonald with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder by Kmart, and seeks as relief permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and officer and director bars.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 1996 and continuing through the present, Israel and Marino have defrauded investors in the Funds and misappropriated millions of dollars in investor funds for their personal use. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions for violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws against Israel, the founder of and investment adviser to the Funds; Bayou Management, the investment adviser to the funds; and Marino, the chief financial officer of Bayou Management. Additionally, the SEC has requested that the court freeze the defendants' assets and appoint a receiver to marshal any remaining assets for the benefit of defrauded hedge fund investors. All of the defendants have consented to the freeze of assets and appointment of a receiver. The requested relief is subject to court approval. Today, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced that it has filed criminal fraud charges against Israel and Marino.

Antonia Chion, an Associate Director of Enforcement, added, ""As our action demonstrates, we not only seek to hold the defendants accountable, but we will work to recover and return assets to harmed investors."" The SEC alleges in its complaint that from 1996 through 2005, investors deposited over $450 million into the Bayou Funds and a predecessor fund. During that period, Israel and Marino defrauded current investors, and attracted new investors, by grossly exaggerating the Funds' performance to make it appear that the Funds were profitable and attractive investments, when in fact, the Funds had never posted a year-end profit. The SEC's complaint further alleges that, in furtherance of their fraud, Israel and Marino concocted and disseminated to the Funds' investors periodic account statements and performance summaries containing fictitious profit and loss figures and forged audited financial statements in order to hide multimillion dollar trading losses from investors.

324,"In an emergency federal court action filed today, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Lohmus Haavel & Viisemann (Lohmus), an Estonian financial services firm, and two of its employees, Oliver Peek and Kristjan Lepik, with conducting a fraudulent scheme involving the electronic theft and trading in advance of more than 360 confidential press releases issued by more than 200 U.S. public companies. The Commission alleges that the defendants fraudulently stole the confidential information from the website of Business Wire, a leading commercial disseminator of news releases and regulatory filings for companies and groups throughout the world, and since January 2005 have made at least $7.8 million in illegal profits. Acting on the Commission's request for emergency relief, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the defendants' assets and orders the repatriation of funds taken out of the United States. ""Our action today demonstrates that we will seek out and stop securities fraud wherever we find it. Whether in an old-fashioned boiler room or, as in this case, in the high-tech environs of the internet, such conduct will be met with a swift and vigorous enforcement response,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""We acted today to stop a clever and pernicious securities fraud and to preserve funds for investors. This case highlights that even when fraudsters invent new ways to violate the securities laws, the Commission will track them down and stop them, wherever they are located,"" said Daniel M. Hawke, Associate District Administrator of the Commission's Philadelphia District Office. The Commission's complaint alleges that, in June 2004, Lohmus became a client of Business Wire for the sole purpose of gaining access to Business Wire's secure client website. Once defendants had access, they surreptitiously utilized a software program, a so-called ""spider"" program, which provided unauthorized access to confidential information contained in impending nonpublic press releases of other Business Wire clients, including the expected time of issuance. The complaint further alleges that the information fraudulently stolen by the defendants has allowed them to strategically time their trades around the public release of news involving, among other things, mergers, earnings, and regulatory actions. Using several U.S. brokerage accounts, the defendants have bought long or sold short the stocks of the companies whose confidential press release information they have stolen, and purchased options to increase their profits. Named in the Commission's complaint are the following defendants. Lohmus Haavel & Viisemann, headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia, is an investment bank established in 1999. Lohmus, which also has offices in Latvia and Lithuania, provides corporate financing, private equity, asset management, investment services, and structured financing services to the Eastern European market. Oliver Peek, age 24, is a citizen of Estonia currently residing in Tallinn. Peek is employed by Lohmus and works for its investment services team. Kristjan Lepik, age 28, is a citizen of Estonia currently residing in Tallinn. Lepik is a partner at Lohmus. As a result of the defendants' conduct, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, together with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. The Commission wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASD, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the Pacific Exchange.

325,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that three affiliates of one of the countrys largest mutual fund managers have agreed to pay $72 million to settle charges they harmed long-term mutual fund shareholders by allowing undisclosed market timing and late trading by favored clients and an employee. The firms are affiliated with Federated Investors, Inc., headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, and perform services for the Federated mutual fund complex. Under the settlement, Federated Investment Management Company (FIMC), a registered investment adviser, Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), a registered broker-dealer, and Federated Shareholder Services Company (FSSC), formerly a registered transfer agent, have been ordered to give up $27 million in ill-gotten gains and pay a $45 million civil penalty, in addition to $8 million they previously paid to the Federated funds that were harmed by the wrongful conduct. Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, the companies also agreed to censures, cease-and-desist orders, and to undertake mutual fund governance and compliance reforms. By allowing undisclosed market timing in Federated funds, FIMC disregarded its fiduciary duties to the funds long-term shareholders. The Commission will continue to pursue mutual fund advisers, and other fiduciaries, who place their interests above those of fund investors, said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commissions Division of Enforcement. The Commissions action today demonstrates its ongoing commitment to protecting mutual fund investors from fraud and unfair dealing. By holding the Federated affiliates accountable and imposing strong sanctions for their conduct, we remind mutual fund advisers that they must act at all times in the best interests of fund shareholders, said Daniel M. Hawke, Associate District Administrator for Enforcement of the Commissions Philadelphia District Office. The Commissions order finds that FIMC, the investment adviser to the Federated funds, and FSC, distributor for the Federated funds, committed securities fraud by approvingbut not disclosing to Federated funds shareholders or the funds Boards of Trusteesthree market timing arrangements, or the associated conflict of interest between FIMC and the funds involved in the arrangements. In addition, FSSC allowed a customer and a Federated employee to late trade. The Commissions order finds that, at the time they entered into the market timing arrangements, FIMC and FSC recognized that certain types of market timing could be generally detrimental to certain of the Federated funds and could, among other things, compromise the investment strategies of portfolio managers and increase costs for long-term shareholders. From January 2003 through July 2003, notwithstanding prospectus disclosure and internal procedures designed to prevent market timing, FIMC and FSC provided approved timing capacity in certain mutual funds to Canary Capital Partners LLC, a hedge fund managed by Edward J. Stern, and never disclosed this arrangement to other Federated fund shareholders or the Federated funds Boards. In return, Canary Capital made a separate investment of non-timed assets, so-called sticky assets, in a Federated fund. At the height of this arrangement, Canary Capital used almost $125 million in timing capacity in six Federated domestic equity funds and invested $10 million in an off-shore Federated fund. FIMC and FSC also entered into undisclosed arrangements with two existing Federated investors to market time high yield bond funds. These two clients used over $18 million and $11 million, respectively, in timing capacity. Both the timed assets and the sticky assets produced advisory and other fees for FIMC, FSC and FSSC. The Commissions order further finds that FSSCs mutual fund trade processing system allowed certain FSSC employees to improperly process trades received after 4:00 p.m. at the current days net asset value (NAV). Between June and September 2003, a Texas hedge fund executed at least 29 late trades through FSSC. In addition, between July 1998 and March 2003, a former FIMC and FSSC employee, while trading for his own account, entered at least 240 trades after 4:00 p.m. that improperly received the current days NAV. Based on the conduct outlined above, the Commissions order finds that FIMC willfully violated, and FSC willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; that FIMC and FSC willfully violated Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 17d-1 thereunder; and that FSSC willfully violated Rule 22c-1(a) under the Investment Company Act. The $72 million will be distributed to investors in the funds pursuant to a plan developed an independent distribution consultant.

326,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that three affiliates of one of the countrys largest mutual fund managers have agreed to pay $72 million to settle charges they harmed long-term mutual fund shareholders by allowing undisclosed market timing and late trading by favored clients and an employee. The firms are affiliated with Federated Investors, Inc., headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, and perform services for the Federated mutual fund complex. Under the settlement, Federated Investment Management Company (FIMC), a registered investment adviser, Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), a registered broker-dealer, and Federated Shareholder Services Company (FSSC), formerly a registered transfer agent, have been ordered to give up $27 million in ill-gotten gains and pay a $45 million civil penalty, in addition to $8 million they previously paid to the Federated funds that were harmed by the wrongful conduct. Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, the companies also agreed to censures, cease-and-desist orders, and to undertake mutual fund governance and compliance reforms. By allowing undisclosed market timing in Federated funds, FIMC disregarded its fiduciary duties to the funds long-term shareholders. The Commission will continue to pursue mutual fund advisers, and other fiduciaries, who place their interests above those of fund investors, said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commissions Division of Enforcement. The Commissions action today demonstrates its ongoing commitment to protecting mutual fund investors from fraud and unfair dealing.

327,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced settled enforcement proceedings against American Express Financial Advisors Inc., now known as Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc.(AEFA), a registered broker-dealer headquartered in Minneapolis, Minn., related to allegations that AEFA failed to adequately disclose millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments that it received from a select group of mutual fund companies. As part of its settlement with the Commission, AEFA will pay $30 million in disgorgement and civil penalties, all of which will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to certain of AEFA's customers. AEFA also agreed to make certain disclosures to its customers about its revenue sharing program. The Commission's Order finds that AEFA began receiving substantial revenue sharing payments and directed brokerage commissions from certain mutual fund families for distribution of fund shares starting in 2001. Since that time, affiliates of these mutual fund families have paid AEFA tens of millions of dollars each year in cash and non-cash revenue sharing payments. With one exception, AEFA has offered on its brokerage platform only mutual fund families whose affiliates made revenue sharing payments to AEFA or its own proprietary funds. At the same time, AEFA failed to disclose to investors that it received tens of millions of dollars each year from these mutual fund families, in addition to commissions and other fees, for selling their mutual funds. AEFA provided these mutual fund families with certain benefits not available to mutual fund families that did not make revenue sharing payments, including, among other things, exclusive shelf space for the sale and marketing of their mutual funds, different levels of access to AEFA's financial advisors depending on how much revenue sharing they paid and reduced or no transaction charges. AEFA also exclusively promoted the 529 college savings plans of mutual fund families from which it received revenue sharing payments. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""This settlement reiterates how important it is for financial industry professionals to fully disclose the nature and extent of their conflicts of interest to customers."" Merri Jo Gillette, Regional Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, added, ""AEFA's undisclosed receipt of millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments from a select group of mutual fund families created a conflict of interest. When customers purchase mutual funds or interests in 529 plans, they must be told about the full nature and extent of any conflict of interest that may affect the transaction."" In addition to the $30 million payment, AEFA has agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-10 promulgated thereunder and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-15. The Commission's Order further requires AEFA to comply with certain undertakings.

329,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled administrative proceeding against Millennium Partners, L.P., Millennium Management, L.L.C., Millennium International Management, L.L.C., Israel Englander, Terence Feeney, Fred Stone, and Kovan Pillai for their participation in a fraudulent scheme to market time mutual funds. The respondents will pay over $180 million in disgorgement and penalties and undertake various compliance reforms to prevent recurrence of similar conduct. The Commission's Order finds that from at least 1999 to 2003, the respondents generated tens of millions of dollars in profits for Millennium by engaging in deceptive market timing. Englander, Feeney, Stone and Pillai knew that mutual funds sought to detect market timers and frequently blocked Millennium's trades and, therefore, devised and carried out various fraudulent means to conceal Millennium's identity and thereby avoid detection and circumvent restrictions that the mutual funds imposed on market timing. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Division of Enforcement, said, ""Today's action demonstrates the Commission's commitment to prosecute vigorously all the wrongdoers involved in fraudulent market timing practices, not just mutual fund managers and broker-dealers, but also the hedge funds and other entities that profited so handsomely from the fraud."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, added, ""The substantial disgorgement and civil penalties imposed on the respondents underscore how seriously the Commission views hedge funds' roles in deceptive market timing schemes and demonstrate to the investing public that beneficiaries of market timing fraud will not be permitted to retain their ill-gotten gains."" Specifically, the Commission Order finds that Millennium, through its senior management, including Englander, Feeney and Stone, and one of its traders, Pillai, engaged in the following conduct. The Commission's Order finds that by engaging in the fraudulent scheme summarized above and described in the Order, the respondents willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act or 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Respondents have consented to an Order that: (1) requires the Respondents to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) prohibits Englander, Feeney, and Stone from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter for a period of three years; (3) denies Stone the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for six months; and (4) suspends Pillai from association with any investment adviser for a period of 12 months. The Order also requires the Respondents to pay disgorgement and civil penalties as follows: (1) Millennium Partners: $121.4 million in disgorgement; (2) Millennium Management and Millennium International Management, jointly and severally: $26.6 million in disgorgement; (3) Englander: a $30 million penalty; (4) Feeney: a $2 million penalty; (5) Stone: a $25,000 penalty; and (6) Pillai: a $150,000 penalty. The money will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to victims. Further, Millennium must comply with certain undertakings, including the retention of an Independent Compliance Consultant to review its compliance program and the establishment of a Compliance, Legal, and Ethics Oversight Committee to ensure that Millennium's illegal conduct does not recur. The Commission's action was brought contemporaneously with a related action by the Attorney General of the State of New York, and the Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Attorney General in this matter.

330,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed and settled insider trading charges both against an accountant and a former executive of Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. who illegally profited from advance knowledge of radio personality Howard Sternâs $500 million contract with Sirius. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Gary D. Herwitz, a certified public accountant and former president of the accounting firm Mahoney Cohen & Company, agreed to pay $52,000, and former Sirius executive vice president Tracey A. Stanyer agreed to pay $35,000 to settle the Commissionâs charges. The SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that Herwitz purchased Sirius stock on September 30, 2004, after learning in confidence from a colleague at Mahoney Cohen, who is Sternâs longtime accountant, that Stern had received an offer from Sirius and that the parties were negotiating. The complaint alleges that Stanyer purchased Sirius stock on October 5, 2004, after learning in confidence from a senior Sirius executive that Sirius had signed an agreement with Stern. The contract was announced the next day. Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commissionâs Northeast Regional Office said, âIt is particularly troubling when accountants or corporate executives, who are entrusted with confidential information, believe they can illegally trade on such information with impunity. This action demonstrates that illegal insider traders should expect a comprehensive and rigorous enforcement response.â Specifically, the Commissionâs complaint alleges the following: Herwitz and Stanyer have agreed to settle the Commissionâs claims by consenting to the entry of separate judgments that permanently enjoin each of them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment against Herwitz also orders him to pay $18,163 to disgorge fully his profits plus prejudgment interest and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $34,000. Similarly, the judgment against Stanyer orders him to pay $17,897 to disgorge fully his profits plus prejudgment interest and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $17,357. The judgment against Stanyer also bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. This concludes the staffâs investigation of this matter.

331,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued top executives of National Century Financial Enterprises, Inc. (NCFE), alleging that they participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by the subsidiaries of the failed Dublin, Ohio company. NCFE, a private corporation, suddenly collapsed along with its subsidiaries in October 2002 when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors. The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $2.6 billion and approximately 275 health-care providers were forced to file for bankruptcy protection. Named in the suit were Lance Poulsen, principal and former Chief Executive Officer of NCFE; Donald S. Ayers, principal and former Chief Operating Officer; Rebecca S. Parrett, principal and former Director of NCFEâs Accounts Receivable Servicer Department; and Randolph H. Speer, former Chief Financial Officer of NCFE. Linda Thomsen, Director of SEC's Enforcement Division, said, âInvestors in private offerings, just like investors in public companies, must be able to rely on the truthfulness of the information they receive before investing. We continue to actively pursue those who provide false information to investors in both private and public securities.â Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office added, âThese defendants, together with others whom the Commission has sued previously, engaged in an elaborate scheme that defrauded investors out of more than $2.6 billion. The Commission will continue to use the full range of its enforcement powers to prosecute individuals who deceive investors and profit at their expense.â The complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleges that NCFE, through two wholly owned subsidiaries, NPF VI and NPF XII (âthe Programsâ), purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables. From at least February 1999 to October 2002, the Programs offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in notes, through 15 private placements, to institutional investors. According to the representations in the offering documents and the Program agreements, the Programs were required to maintain certain reserve-account balances and medical accounts receivable as collateral to secure the notes. Nevertheless, the complaint alleges that Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer depleted the Programsâ reserve accounts and collateral base by âadvancingâ at least $1.2 billion from the Programsâ funds to health-care providers without receiving eligible receivables in return. These advances were essentially unsecured loans by the Programs to distressed or defunct health-care providers â many of which were wholly or partly owned by NCFE, Poulsen, Parrett and/or Ayers. According to the complaint, Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer concealed their fraud from investors and others by: In the complaint, the Commission seeks to: (1) permanently enjoin each Defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bar each Defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) order each Defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, in amounts to be determined. The Commission has already obtained judgments against three other former NCFE executives: Sherry Gibson, a former Executive Vice President of Compliance of NCFE; John Snoble, a former Vice President and Controller; and Brian Stucke, a former Associate Vice-President for Business Services. Each of these individuals has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting them from violating the federal securities laws; an order barring him or her from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined. Moreover, each of these three former NCFE executives has pled guilty in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio to criminal charges arising from the scheme to defraud. Gibson pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and was sentenced to four years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Gibson is currently serving her prison sentence at the Lexington Federal Medical Center in Kentucky and is scheduled to be released on March 28, 2008. Stucke pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and Snoble pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy; both are awaiting sentencing.

To evade the mutual fundsâ restrictions, Veras created legal entities with names unrelated to Veras to hide its true identity from mutual funds. Veras used the legal entities to open multiple accounts at multiple broker-dealers to evade the trading restrictions imposed by mutual funds.

334,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed charges against six former officers of Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a Boston-based registered transfer agent, for engaging in a scheme beginning in January 2001 by which the defendants defrauded a defined contribution plan client and group of Putnam mutual funds of approximately $4 million. The six defendants are Karnig Durgarian, a former senior managing director and chief of operations for PFTC, as well as principal executive officer of certain Putnam mutual funds from 2002 through 2004; Donald McCracken, a former managing director and head of global operations services for PFTC; Virginia Papa, a former managing director and director of defined contribution servicing; Sandra Childs, a former managing director who had overall responsibility for PFTC's compliance department; Kevin Crain, a managing director who had responsibility for PFTC's plan administration unit; and Ronald Hogan, a former vice-president who had responsibility for new business implementation at PFTC. The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against PFTC because of its swift, extensive and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation of the transactions that are the subject of the Commission's complaint. PFTC's cooperation consisted of prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, sharing the results of that investigation with the government (including not asserting any applicable privileges and protections with respect to written materials furnished to the Commission staff), terminating and otherwise disciplining responsible wrongdoers, providing full restitution to its defrauded clients, paying for the attorneys' and consultants' fees of its defrauded clients, and implementing new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct. Walter G. Ricciardi, Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement and District Administrator of the Commission's Boston District Office stated: ""Although the conduct alleged here was egregious, PFTC's cooperation in this investigation and the remedial steps taken were extraordinary. In recognition of the company's actions, the Commission has determined it appropriate not to bring any enforcement action against PFTC in connection with the charges we are announcing today. We hope the Commission's actions here will encourage those who become aware of wrongdoing to do the right thing - stop the wrongful conduct, promptly report it to the Commission staff, and cooperate fully in any subsequent investigation of the conduct."" The Commission's complaint, which was filed on Dec. 30, 2005 in U.S. District Court in Boston, alleges that the defendants' misconduct arose out of PFTC's one-day delay in investing certain assets of a defined contribution client, Cardinal Health, Inc., in January 2001. The markets rose steeply on the missed day, causing Cardinal Health's defined contribution plan to miss out on nearly $4 million of market gains. According to the complaint, rather than inform Cardinal Health of the one-day delay or compensate their client for the missed trading gain, the defendants decided to improperly shift approximately $3 million of the costs of the delay to shareholders of certain Putnam mutual funds through deception, illegal trade reversals, and accounting machinations. The complaint also alleges that the defendants improperly allowed Cardinal Health's defined contribution plan to bear approximately $1 million of the loss without disclosing to Cardinal Heath that they had done so. The complaint further alleges that Durgarian, Papa, Childs, and Crain also took steps to cover-up the wrongful conduct. As a result, the conduct was not discovered until January 2004.

335,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against McAfee, Inc., formerly known as Network Associates, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based manufacturer and supplier of computer security and antivirus tools. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that, from the second quarter of 1998 through 2000, McAfee misled investors when it engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate its revenue and earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars. The complaint specifically alleges that, during the period 1998 through 2000, McAfee inflated its cumulative net revenues by $622 million and that, for 1998 alone, McAfee overstated revenues by $562 million, a misstatement of 131 percent. When the scheme began to unravel and McAfee announced, in December 2000, that it would miss its quarterly revenue projection by $190 million, the news slashed over $1 billion from McAfeeâs market capitalization. McAfee consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a Court order enjoining it from violating the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. The order also requires that McAfee pay a $50 million civil penalty, which the Commission will seek to distribute to harmed investors pursuant to the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, McAfee has agreed to appoint an independent consultant to examine and recommend improvements to McAfeeâs internal accounting controls and revenue recognition and reserves practices to better ensure compliance with the federal securities laws. This proposed settlement is subject to court approval. ÂThis settlement takes into account both the underlying misconduct and the resulting investor harm, as well as the significant benefit that accrued to McAfee from having artificially inflated the price of its stock and using it to acquire other companies, capitalizing on the artificial value McAfee had created through its fraud,Â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the Director of the SECÂs Division of Enforcement. ÂThe companyÂs channel-stuffing and use of manipulative accounting artifices warrants a severe civil sanction that will act as a deterrent for other public companies and provide a source of funds that can be distributed to injured McAfee investors.Â The Commission alleges in its complaint that McAfee used a variety of undisclosed ploys during the period to aggressively oversell its products to distributors in amounts that far exceeded the publicâs demand for the products. While engaging in this channel-stuffing, McAfee improperly recorded the sales to distributors as revenue. McAfee offered its distributors lucrative sales incentives that included deep price discounts and rebates in an effort to persuade the distributors to continue to buy and stockpile McAfee products. McAfee also secretly paid distributors millions of dollars to hold the excess inventory, rather than return it to McAfee for a refund and consequent reduction in McAfeeâs revenues. In other instances, McAfee used an undisclosed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Net Tools, Inc., to repurchase inventory that McAfee had oversold to its distributors. The complaint further alleges that McAfee took action to conceal the fraud from investors by, among other things, wrongly recording in its books the payments and discounts that it offered to distributors, and improperly manipulating reserve accounts to increase inadequate sales reserves and cover the costs of the distributor payments. The complaint alleges that McAfee defrauded investors by reporting false and materially misleading financial and other information in periodic reports, financial statements, and securities registration statements that McAfee filed with the Commission, and in press releases and other public statements. Previously, the Commission has sued former McAfee chief financial officer Prabhat Goyal and former McAfee controller Terry Davis for their roles in the fraudulent accounting at McAfee. Both of those actions have been stayed by the Court pending the resolution of criminal proceedings that have been brought by the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California against Goyal and Davis.",-0.5,Negative

340,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Merrill Lynch broker and ten former day traders and managers from A.B. Watley, Inc. (Watley), a broker-dealer, with participating in a fraudulent scheme that used squawk boxes to obtain the confidential institutional customer order flow of major brokerages, such as Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch. ""Squawk boxes"" are devices that broadcast, within a securities firm, institutional orders to buy and sell large blocks of securities. This broadcast information was used by traders to ""trade ahead"" of these large institutional orders. In a separate action in August 2005, the Commission charged five individuals as part of this scheme. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""This fraud stretched from the biggest firms on Wall Street to a small day-trading shop. The common denominator was a willingness to steal confidential market information for use in illegal trading."" Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""Institutional customers count on the confidentiality of their orders to insure the best price in the market."" The Commission charged the following defendants. Watley Group, a Delaware corporation, is a publicly-traded holding company that conducts its business through broker-dealer subsidiaries, including Watley. Paul F. Coughlin, age 34, is a resident of New York, N.Y. Coughlin was a broker at Merrill Lynch in New York City. William B. Deakins, age 37, is a resident of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Deakins was a proprietary trader at Watley and also was a manager of Watley's proprietary trading desk. Warren R. Fellus, age 34, is a resident of Roslyn, N.Y. Fellus was a proprietary trader at Watley. Keith M. Geller, age 31, is a resident of New York, N.Y. Geller was a proprietary trader at Watley. Keevin H. Leonard, age 45, is a resident of Montvale, N.J. Leonard was a manager of the proprietary trading desk at Watley. Robert F. Malin, age 41, is a resident of New York, N.Y. Robert Malin served as President of Watley as well as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors at Watley Group. Steven E. Malin, age 49, is a resident of New York, N.Y. Steven Malin was the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Watley Group. Linus N. Nwaigwe, age 49, is a resident of Valley Stream, N.Y. Nwaigwe was director of compliance at Watley. Michael A. Picone, age 50, is a resident of New York, N.Y. Picone was the Chief Operating Officer of Watley Group and also worked as a consultant to Watley Group. Bryan S. Rogers, age 35, is a resident of East Meadow, N.Y. Bryan Rogers was a proprietary trader at Watley. Keith A. Rogers, age 32, is a resident of Franklin Square, N.Y. Keith Rogers was a proprietary trader at Watley. The Commission alleges that the Watley day traders asked retail brokers at Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, including Coughlin, to furnish access to their firms' institutional equities squawk boxes. The brokers then placed their telephone receivers next to the squawk boxes and left open phone connections to the Watley office in place for virtually entire trading days. The Watley traders, including Deakins, Fellus, Geller, Keith Rogers, and Bryan Rogers, listened for indications on the squawk boxes that these firms had received large customer orders and then ""traded ahead"" in the same securities, with the understanding that the prices of the securities would move in response to the subsequent filling of the customer orders. Between approximately June 2002 and January 2004, the Watley day traders traded ahead of customer orders they heard on the Citigroup, Merrill, and Lehman squawk boxes on more than 400 occasions, making gross profits of at least $675,000. In exchange for live audio access to the squawk boxes, Watley compensated the brokers with commission-generating trades and/or secret cash payments. Watley made over $5 million in processing fees from the Watley day traders from June 2002 through August 2003, in addition to receiving a percentage of the profits generated by the Watley traders. Leonard, Robert Malin, Steven Malin, Nwaigwe, Picone, and others furthered this trading ahead scheme. For example, Robert Malin and Steven Malin authorized the transformation of Watley into a proprietary day trading firm that relied on Amore's access to the squawk box information. Leonard collected cash from Watley traders in order to make cash bribes to the brokers providing access to the squawk boxes. Robert Malin and Picone authorized the payment of cash bribes to Coughlin. Nwaigwe concealed the trading ahead scheme from regulators. After leaving Watley in early 2003, Fellus established a day trading desk at another broker-dealer headquartered in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., and continued to engage in a trading ahead scheme. The day traders at this firm generated at least $125,000 in gross profits. By divulging confidential information concerning customer orders, the brokers, including Coughlin, breached duties of confidentiality and trust they owed to their employers and to their employers' customers. These brokers also violated their firm's written policies requiring confidential treatment of customer information. The Commission's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, charges Watley Group, Coughlin, Deakins, Fellus, Geller, Leonard, Robert Malin, Steven Malin, Picone, Bryan Rogers, and Keith Rogers with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Nwaigwe with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint charges all of the individual defendants with aiding and abetting A.B. Watley, Inc.'s violations of Section 15(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, penalties, and an injunction against future violations against the defendants, as well as officer and director bars against Robert Malin, Steven Malin, and Picone. In a separate settled administrative and cease and desist proceeding instituted today, the Commission issued an order against Sanjay Singh, a manager of Watley's day trading desk, who facilitated the trading ahead scheme. This order requires Singh to cease and desist from committing and/or causing violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act; bars Singh from association with any broker or dealer; and orders Singh to pay disgorgement in the amount of $37,500. Singh consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying any of the findings.

341,"\- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Tyco International Ltd. The Commission's complaint in that action alleges that, from 1996 through 2002, Tyco violated the federal securities laws by, among other things, utilizing various improper accounting practices and a scheme involving transactions with no economic substance to overstate its reported financial results by at least one billion dollars. ""This enforcement action shows that, in addition to looting the company, Tyco's Kozlowski-era management lied about the company's financial results,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""Tyco benefited from this fraud, as the penalty in this case reflects."" Scott W. Friestad, Associate SEC Enforcement Director, stated, ""The Tyco accounting fraud was orchestrated at the highest levels of the company, but carried out at numerous operating units and management levels of the company. 'Push down' frauds like this are especially difficult to detect and investigate. Today's enforcement action shows that the Commission and its staff will pursue such misconduct and take appropriate action."" The Commission's complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by at least $500 million as a result of improper accounting practices related to some of the many acquisitions that Tyco engaged in during that time. Tyco's improper acquisition accounting included undervaluing acquired assets, overvaluing acquired liabilities, and misusing accounting rules concerning the establishment and utilization of purchase accounting reserves. The complaint further alleges that, apart from its acquisition activities, Tyco improperly established and used various kinds of reserves to make adjustments at the end of reporting periods to enhance and smooth its publicly reported results and to meet earnings forecasts. The complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by $567 million from its fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2002, by means of connection fees that Tyco's ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary charged to dealers from whom it purchased security monitoring contracts. Because the connection fee was fully offset by a simultaneous increase in the purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers' security monitoring contracts, the connection fee transaction lacked economic substance and should not have been recorded in Tyco's income statement. In 2003, Tyco restated its operating income and cash flow relating to the connection fees. The complaint further alleges that, from September 1996 through early 2002, Tyco failed to disclose in its proxy statements and annual reports certain executive compensation, executive indebtedness, and related party transactions of its former senior management. Tyco also incorrectly accounted for certain executive bonuses it paid in its fiscal years 2000 and 2001, thereby excluding from its operating expenses the costs associated with those bonuses. Finally, the complaint alleges that Tyco violated the antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when employees or agents of its Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. subsidiary made payments to Brazilian officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for Tyco. Between 1996 and 2002, as a result of these various practices, Tyco made false and misleading statements or omissions in its filings with the Commission and its public statements to investors and analysts. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, Tyco has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, proxy disclosure, periodic reporting, corporate recordkeeping, and antibribery provisions of the federal securities laws. The proposed final judgment also orders Tyco to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $50 million civil penalty. The penalty amount, which was provisionally negotiated in 2005, was reviewed and approved by the Commission in light of the considerations set forth in ""Statement of the Securities and Exchange Commission Concerning Financial Penalties,"" Press Release 2006-4 (Jan. 4, 2006).

342,"The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) announced today that the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) has agreed to settle charges relating to the misstatement of its financial statements from at least 1998 through 2004. Fannie Mae has agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction and to pay a $400 million penalty. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement said, ""Fannie Mae's departure from proper accounting practices allowed it to present to its shareholders and the marketplace financial statements showing stable and predictable earnings. But the impression created by the Company's financial statements was a false one. Transparency and accurate disclosure are the keys to good corporate governance and should be the rule, not the exception."" ""Strong accounting controls, though a recognized cost center, can significantly help detect and deter violations of the federal securities laws,"" said Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of Enforcement. ""Fannie Mae failed to devote sufficient resources to its accounting, and the results for the company and for its investors have been unfortunate. Public companies should learn from this lesson and ensure that their internal controls and accounting practices are, at a minimum, sufficient to meet their compliance obligations."" In its settlement with the Commission, the company agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The root cause of the accounting fraud described in the Commission's Complaint, was a corporate culture that placed significant emphasis on stable earnings growth and avoidance of income statement volatility, and insufficient emphasis on ensuring compliance with applicable accounting regulations and federal securities laws. The company's misconduct took various forms. For example: At the end of 1998, senior management manipulated the company's earnings in order to obtain bonuses they otherwise would not have received. Senior management of the company directed employees to record only $240 million of amortization expenses. By not recording the full amount of the calculated expenses, Fannie Mae understated its expenses and overstated its income by a pre-tax amount of $199 million. The company's management made two additional adjustments in the fourth quarter of 1998 that had the effect of offsetting nearly half the $240 million amortization expense adjustment. This resulted in the company not only exceeding Wall Street expectations but also hitting the earnings per share target necessary to trigger maximum bonuses. Fannie Mae has agreed, without admitting or denying these allegations, to a fraud injunction for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. From at least 1998 through 2004, the company's financial results were smoothed as a result of the misapplication of certain Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); namely rules relating to the amortization of loan fees, premiums and discounts, known as SFAS 91, and rules relating to hedge accounting, known as SFAS 133. In both instances, while Fannie Mae recognized that the company was departing from GAAP, it failed properly to consider whether the departures were material. Under SFAS 91, companies are required to recognize loan fees, premiums and discounts as an adjustment over the life of the applicable loans. Fannie Mae had a policy of not recording those amounts that fell within a company-calculated threshold. Such a policy was an improper departure from GAAP and had the effect of reducing earnings volatility. The company also failed on many occasions to comply with SFAS 133, which essentially provides that derivatives must be revalued every reporting period, and changes to value must be reported in the income statement. Fannie Mae disregarded the requirements of SFAS 133 and qualified transactions for certain hedge accounting treatment based on erroneous interpretations and an unjustified reliance on materiality. As a result, it failed to measure and record the differential between the change in value of the derivative and the change in value of the item being hedged by the derivative. These failures to comply with SFAS 91 and SFAS 133 led to the Company publicly issuing materially false and misleading financial statements from at least 1998 through the second quarter of 2004. Fannie Mae has agreed, without admitting or denying these allegations, to an injunction for violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result of the violations described in the Commission's complaint, Fannie Mae expects to restate its historical financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2003, and 2002, and for the quarters ended June 30, 2004, and March 31, 2004. The company currently estimates that its restatement will result in at least an $11 billion reduction of previously reported net income. The terms of the settlement require Fannie Mae to pay a $400 million penalty that has been negotiated jointly with OFHEO and the SEC.

343,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of securities fraud charges against three former top officers of an operator of national restaurant chains in connection with their receipt of approximately one million dollars in undisclosed compensation, participation in undisclosed related party transactions, and financial statement fraud from 2000 to 2004. The SEC charges were filed against Buca, Inc.'s former CEO, Joseph Micatrotto, the company's former CFO, Greg Gadel, and its former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek. Buca is a Minneapolis, Minn., company that operates the Buca di Beppo and Vinny T's of Boston national restaurant chains. ""Buca's top officers created a tone at the top and a corporate culture that allowed them to loot the company and engage in a financial fraud,"" stated Linda Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""Such conduct is a fundamental violation of the trust placed in corporate officers by public shareholders and cannot be countenanced."" ""The fraud that pervaded the executive suite at Buca existed because the company's top officers showed scant regard for sound corporate governance,"" said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office. ""The sanctions obtained against Buca's former CEO, Mr. Micatrotto, demonstrate that the Commission will deal with such conduct in the strongest terms."" Micatrotto has agreed to settle the Commission's action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $500,000 and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In setting the disgorgement amount, the Commission took into account Micatrotto's previous payments to Buca in connection with his undisclosed compensation and his transfer of title of an Italian villa to Buca. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2000 to 2003, Micatrotto obtained undisclosed compensation in the amount of $849,100 by improperly billing Buca for a wide variety of personal and non-business expenses. In a separate action, filed against Buca's former CFO, Greg A. Gadel, and former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel and Skrypek approved many of Micatrotto's inappropriate reimbursement requests. The complaint against Micatrotto alleges that Buca ""reimbursed"" the former CEO for, among other things, $131,000 in cash withdrawals from ATMs; a total of $127,000 for the same airline tickets submitted for reimbursement multiple times; the entire bill for the groom's dinner at his son's wedding; and other personal expenses, including dog kenneling and the remodeling of his homes in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. However, since these payments were not made to reimburse legitimate business expenses, they constituted additional compensation to Micatrotto and should have been reflected as such on Buca's books. They were not. As a result, Buca's proxy statements for this time period understated Micatrotto's annual compensation by amounts ranging from 27% to 74%. The Commission's complaint further alleges that Micatrotto engaged in two undisclosed related-party transactions. First, in 2001 Micatrotto used Buca funds to purchase an Italian villa in the name of himself and his wife, and then arranged for Buca to pay for certain improvements to the villa. Second, in June 2003 Micatrotto personally received $65,000 from one of Buca's vendors. The complaint charges Micatrotto with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, proxy, reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. In its separate action against Buca's former CFO, Gadel, and former Controller, Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel, from 2000 to 2003, received approximately $96,630 in undisclosed compensation, including reimbursements that he obtained from Buca for family vacations and visits to strip clubs. The complaint further alleges that Gadel knew of a series of undisclosed related party transactions totaling more than $1 million between Buca and an information technology company of which Gadel was a director and shareholder. Finally, the Commission's complaint alleges that Gadel and Skrypek directed a financial fraud in which Buca inflated its income by nearly $12 million from 2000 to 2004 through the improper capitalization of numerous expenses. The financial fraud caused Buca to overstate its annual income in amounts ranging from 18.8% to 36.9%. The Commission's complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota and alleges that Gadel and Skrypek violated, and aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud, proxy, reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. This matter is unsettled and the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, civil penalties and officer and director bars. The SEC's Midwest Regional Office and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota conducted parallel investigations of this matter and, simultaneous with the Commission's announcement of the above actions, the United States Attorney's Office announced the filing of mail and wire fraud charges against Micatrotto and Gadel.",-0.46153846153846156,Negative

345,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil charges against three former senior executives of Comverse Technology, Inc. (Comverse), alleging that they engaged in a decade-long fraudulent scheme to grant undisclosed, in-the-money options to themselves and to others by backdating stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of Comverse common stock. Two of the executives, Comverse's founder and former Chairman and CEO Jacob ""Kobi"" Alexander, and David Kreinberg, Comverse's former Chief Financial Officer, also created a slush fund of backdated options by causing options to be granted to fictitious employees and, later, used these options to recruit and retain key personnel. The other executive charged in the SEC complaint is William F. Sorin, Comverse's former General and Senior General Counsel, and a former Comverse director. The complaint alleges that the former executives collectively realized millions of dollars of ill-gotten compensation through the exercise of illegally backdated option grants and the subsequent sale of Comverse common stock. As part of the scheme, the former executives made material misrepresentations to investors regarding Comverse's stock option grants and concealed from investors that Comverse had not recorded compensation expenses for option grants. As a result, Comverse, a maker of software, systems, and related services for multimedia communication and information processing applications headquartered in New York, N.Y., materially overstated its net income and earnings per share between 1991 and at least 2002. In a separate matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today unsealed a criminal complaint charging Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin with conspiracy to violate the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, wire fraud, and mail fraud by engaging in the same scheme. ""Shareholders have a right to full, complete, and accurate information regarding executive compensation. As alleged, the backdated option grants and secret option slush fund was a deceit of the highest order upon Comverse Technology Inc.'s shareholders,"" said Linda Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. ""The action we take today represents another step in the Commission's ongoing effort to address and stamp out fraudulent stock-option practices."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement said, ""The defendants charged today allegedly realized millions of dollars in illicit compensation through their secret backdating scheme and grossly misled Comverse Technology, Inc. investors by repeatedly representing in various disclosure documents that options granted to themselves and others were not in-the-money grants. This action, brought after a five-month investigation, indicates that the Division of Enforcement is prepared to marshal its resources to aggressively and quickly pursue fraudulent stock option practices."" The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York after a five-month investigation, alleges that, beginning in 1991, Alexander repeatedly used hindsight to select a date when the closing price of Comverse's common stock was at or near a quarterly or annual low. Alexander later communicated this date and closing price to Sorin in order for it to be used as the date of, and exercise price for, a grant of Comverse options. Sorin, with Alexander's knowledge, then created company records that falsely indicated that a committee of Comverse's board of directors had actually approved the option grant on the date Alexander had ""cherry-picked."" Kreinberg, the complaint alleges, joined the scheme no later than 1998, and assisted Alexander in selecting backdated grant dates. Kreinberg knew that company records reflected false grant dates. Alexander and Kreinberg, according to the complaint, also created a slush fund of backdated Comverse options between 1999 and 2002 by, among other methods, secretly inserting fictitious names amid the names of actual Comverse employees on proposed option grantee lists which then were submitted to a committee of Comverse's board of directors for approval. Kreinberg instructed a Comverse employee to conceal the existence of the slush fund from Comverse's auditors and in March 2006, after learning that a special committee of Comverse's board would investigate the company's option grants, Kreinberg undertook to hide the existence of the slush fund by altering records in Comverse's electronic option-tracking system. Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin also made misrepresentations to Comverse's auditors in order to conceal the backdating scheme. As a result of the scheme, the complaint alleges that Alexander realized actual gains of nearly $138 million from sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options that were granted during the 1991 through 2001 period. At least $6.4 million of this gain represents the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Alexander. Kreinberg realized an actual gain of nearly $13 million from sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options that were granted during the 1994 to 2001 period, with at least $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Kreinberg. Sorin realized an actual gain of more than $14 million from sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options that were granted during the 1991 to 2001 period, with approximately $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Sorin. The complaint alleges that under well-settled accounting principles in effect at the time, companies that granted in-the-money options were required to record a corresponding compensation expense and disclose such amounts in filings with the Commission. Comverse has publicly announced that it expects to restate historical financial results for multiple years in order to record additional, material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses. Between fiscal year 2001 and 2002, Kreinberg, with Sorin's knowledge, is alleged to have initiated a similar backdating scheme at Ulticom, Inc., a publicly-traded, majority-owned subsidiary of Comverse. Like Comverse, Ulticom has publicly announced that it expects to restate historical financial results for multiple years in order to record additional, material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses. The Commission's complaint charges Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin with violations of the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, misrepresentations to auditors, and ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Alexander and Kreinberg are separately charged with violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley officer certification provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, the Commission's complaint alleges that Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin aided and abetted Comverse's and/or Ulticom's violations of the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission's action seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties, disgorgement, with prejudgment interest, and officer and director bars against each of the defendants.

347,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of securities fraud charges against Dawn M. Schlegel and Sandra L. Hatfield, two former officers of DHB Industries, Inc., a major supplier of body armor to the United States military and law enforcement agencies. The SEC alleges that Schlegel, DHB's former Chief Financial Officer, and Hatfield, DHB's former Chief Operating Officer, routinely overstated the value of the company's inventory and directed the booking of numerous fraudulent journal entries in order to reduce the company's cost of goods sold. This had the effect of falsely increasing the company's gross profit margins, and in some instances, net income. As a result of their misconduct, DHB materially misstated key financial information in filings with the SEC and in public statements. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""By manipulating DHB's gross profit margin, Schlegel and Hatfield knew that investors would be given a false portrait of DHB's operating results. The Commission will not tolerate accounting fraud because it not only deceives the company's shareholders but undermines public confidence in our financial markets."" David Nelson, Director of the SEC's Southeast Regional Office in Miami, stated, ""Schlegel and Hatfield showed wanton disregard for DHB's investors and the federal securities laws. Today's action seeks to restore investor confidence by holding them accountable."" According to the SEC's complaint, Schlegel, of Eastport, N.Y., and Hatfield, of Pompano Beach, Fla., regularly overstated the value of DHB's inventory by fraudulently increasing inventory quantities, labor costs, overhead costs, and the amount of raw materials used in DHB's products. The complaint alleges that Hatfield and Schlegel also transferred millions of dollars of expenses from cost of goods sold to research and development costs to materially increase the company's gross profit. The complaint further alleges that Schlegel falsely inflated DHB's $60 million charge against earnings taken in the third quarter of 2005 to mask her and Hatfield's fraudulent conduct. Schlegel is alleged to have lied to DHB's auditors and provided fake inventory schedules and other documents to conceal the fraud. The complaint also alleges that during the period of their fraudulent conduct, Schlegel and Hatfield collectively profited by over $8.2 million from the cashless exercise of warrants and sale of over 400,000 DHB shares. Schlegel and Hatfield sold these shares at the end of 2004 at the height of DHB's stock price and before the public knew about the misrepresentations in DHB's filings and public statements.

348,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against two securities promoters who fraudulently raised $2.2 million through sales of oil and leases to at least 70 investors nationwide. In announcing the charges, the SEC also issued an investor alert available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/oilgasscams.htm warning investors to beware of solicitations that prey on fears of higher oil and gas prices. The Commission alleges that between August 2002 and July 2005, Ivan Dearaujo, the principal of California-based PetroSite Assets, Inc., and the company's salesperson, Wesley A. Harbison, Jr., sold participation interests in the future production revenue of oil and gas wells. Dearaujo and Harbison misrepresented PetroSite's ownership of wells and overstated the anticipated well production, according to the Commissions complaint, and kept a yet-undetermined amount of the money for themselves. ""Rising fuel prices make investors across the nation particularly susceptible to oil and gas scams,"" said Katherine Addleman, Associate District Administrator for Enforcement in the Commission's Fort Worth Office. ""Investors are led to believe that it will be easy to profit from an oil and gas venture. However, oil and gas investments are highly speculative and complex and many unscrupulous individuals use that complexity to enrich themselves with the investors' funds."" Rose Romero, District Administrator of the Fort Worth Office, said, ""The actions taken today by the Commission, including seeking a receiver to assume control of the companies and the oil and gas interests, not only call for sanctions against those who victimized investors but also will help to redress the harm to these investors. In addition, our actions should serve as a warning to investors of the existence of this threat in connection with oil and gas offerings."" The Commission alleges that Dearaujo defrauded the PetroSite investors at the time of the initial investment by misappropriating a substantial portion of their funds, instead of investing the money in the wells. The Commission further alleges that Dearaujo defrauded the PetroSite investors as the business progressed by diverting for his own benefit much of the revenue generated by the wells. Harbison, according to the complaint, was paid a commission on his sales of the PetroSite participation interests, and participated knowingly in Dearaujo's misrepresentation of those interests. The Commission also filed fraud charges Dearaujo and Harbison for fraudulently raising $250,000 between June and December, 2005, through sales of stock in an inactive jewelry business, Masset, Inc., another California-based issuer. The Commission alleges that Dearaujo and Harbison defrauded the Masset investors by misrepresenting Masset's business prospects and financial stability and by exaggerating, without basis, the likely future value of Masset stock. In its complaint, the Commission charges PetroSite, Masset, Dearujo and Harbison with violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws. The Commission is also charging Harbison with acting as a securities broker without having been registered with the Commission. The Commission is seeking against each of the defendants a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty, and penny stock bars against Dearaujo and Harbison. The Commission is also seeking against each of the defendants orders requiring an accounting and prohibiting the destruction of records, and, with respect to PetroSite and Masset, the appointment of a receiver to marshal and conserve PetroSite's and Masset's assets for the benefit of the investors.

Merritt, the former CEO and former controller, respectively, of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RenRe) and also against Michael W. Cash, a former senior executive of RenRe's wholly-owned subsidiary, Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd. The complaint, filed today in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Stanard, Merritt, and Cash structured and executed a sham transaction that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to smooth and defer over $26 million of RenRe's earnings from 2001 to 2002 and 2003. The Commission also announced a partial settlement of its charges against Merritt, who has consented to the entry of an antifraud injunction and other relief. Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""This is another case arising from our ongoing investigation of the misuse of finite reinsurance to commit securities fraud. The defendants enabled RenRe to take excess revenue from one good year and, in effect, 'park' it with a counterparty so it would be available to bring back in a future year when the company's financial picture was not as bright."" Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said, ""The investing public relies upon senior executives of public companies not to engage in transactions that are designed to misstate their companies' financial statements. Today's enforcement action underscores that the Commission will pursue culpable senior officials who are instrumental in constructing fraudulent transactions."" The Defendants RenRe's Fraud The Commission alleges that Stanard, Merritt and Cash committed fraud in connection with a sham transaction that they concocted to smooth RenRe's earnings. The complaint concerns two seemingly separate, unrelated contracts that were, in fact, intertwined. Together, the contracts created a round trip of cash. In the first contract, RenRe purported to assign at a discount $50 million of recoverables due to RenRe under certain industry loss warranty contracts to Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Company, Ltd. in exchange for $30 million in cash, for a net transfer to Inter-Ocean of $20 million. RenRe recorded income of $30 million upon executing the assignment agreement. The remaining $20 million of its $50 million assignment became part of a ""bank"" or ""cookie jar"" that RenRe used in later periods to bolster income. The second contract was a purported reinsurance agreement with Inter-Ocean that was, in fact, a vehicle to refund to RenRe the $20 million transferred under the assignment agreement plus the purported insurance premium paid under the reinsurance agreement. This reinsurance agreement was a complete sham. Not only was RenRe certain to meet the conditions for coverage; it also would receive back all of the money paid to Inter-Ocean under the agreements plus investment income earned on the money in the interim, less transactional fees and costs. RenRe accounted for the sham transaction as if it involved a real reinsurance contract that transferred risk from RenRe to Inter-Ocean when in fact, the complaint alleges, each of these individuals knew that this was not true. Merritt and Stanard also misrepresented or omitted certain key facts about the transaction to RenRe's auditors. As a result of RenRe's accounting treatment for this transaction, RenRe materially understated income in 2001 and materially overstated income in 2002, at which time it made a ""claim"" under the ""reinsurance"" agreement. It then received as apparent reinsurance proceeds the funds it had paid to Inter-Ocean and that Inter-Ocean held in a trust for RenRe's benefit. On Feb. 22, 2005, RenRe issued a press release announcing that it would restate its financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. On March 31, 2005, RenRe filed its Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, which contained restated financial statements for those years. Stanard signed and certified the 2004 Form 10-K. Both the press release and the Form 10-K attributed the restatement of the Inter-Ocean transaction to accounting ""errors"" due to ""the timing of the recognition of Inter-Ocean reinsurance recoverables."" These statements were misleading. In fact, the transaction contained no real reinsurance and the company's restated financial statements accounted for the transaction as if it had never occurred. In short, the entire transaction was a sham, and the company failed to disclose that fact and misrepresented the reasons for the restatement. The Commission's Charges The Commission's complaint charges Stanard, Merritt and Cash with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) of the Exchange Act; with violating the reporting, books-and-records and internal control provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1; and with aiding and abetting RenRe's violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c), 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13. In addition, the complaint charges Stanard and Merritt with violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 for making materially false statements to RenRe's auditors and charges Stanard with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 for certifying financial statements filed with the Commission that he knew contained materially false and misleading information. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any, plus prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and orders barring each defendant from acting as an officer or director of any public company. Partial Resolution Merritt agreed to partially settle the Commission's claims against him. In addition to undertaking to cooperate fully with the Commission, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Merritt consented to a partial final judgment that, upon entry by the court, will permanently enjoin him from violating or aiding or abetting future violations of the securities laws, bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and defer the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date. Merritt also agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, barring him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Merritt was a certified public accountant licensed to practice in Massachusetts.",-0.2857142857142857,Negative
350,"\- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled financial fraud charges in federal court in Detroit against Delphi Corporation, a Troy, Mich., auto parts supplier. In its complaint, the Commission charges Delphi with engaging in a pattern of fraudulent conduct between 2000 and 2004. The Commission also charges thirteen individuals for their alleged roles in the fraudulent conduct and/or in related reporting and books-and-records violations by Delphi. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""This case demonstrates again that the Commission will take strong action when a company and its officers engage in accounting fraud in order to hide the company's financial difficulties from investors, analysts, and others. The facts here are particularly troubling because of the number of fraudulent schemes engaged in by Delphi, the length of time over which they occurred, and the number of Delphi employees, including senior officers, who carried out the schemes."" The complaint charges seven former Delphi employees and two others with participating in or aiding and abetting Delphi's fraud. The complaint also charges four individuals with aiding and abetting Delphi's reporting and books-and-records violations. The Commission's complaint alleges that, between 2000 and 2004, Delphi engaged in multiple schemes that resulted in Delphi materially misstating its financial condition and operating results in filings with the Commission, offering documents, press releases, and other documents and statements. The allegations include the following. Delphi simultaneously settled the charges, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. Fredric D. Firestone, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, stated, ""Despite engaging in widespread fraudulent conduct, Delphi took significant remedial steps and cooperated extensively with the Commission's investigation. Consistent with the principles announced in the Commission's January 2006 Statement Concerning Financial Penalties, the Commission considered Delphi's remediation and cooperation, among other things, in deciding not to impose a penalty."" In addition to settling with Delphi, the Commission simultaneously settled with six individuals, who also neither admitted nor denied the Commission's allegations. Each of the settlements is subject to court approval, and Delphi's settlement is also subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing Delphi's bankruptcy. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation in this investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

351,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled enforcement actions against eight former officers and directors of Spiegel, Inc., an Illinois-based public company. During the relevant period, Spiegel owned and operated catalogue retailers Spiegel, Eddie Bauer and Newport News. The Commission filed settled charges against the former Co-Presidents of Spiegel, Michael Moran and James Sievers, former CEO Martin Zaepfel, former CFO James Cannataro, and former Treasurer John Steele, in connection with the overstatement of the performance of Spiegel's credit card receivables portfolio. In addition, the Commission settled with the former Chairman of Spiegel's Board of Directors, Michael Otto, two former directors, Michael Crusemann and Horst Hansen, and former CEO Martin Zaepfel in connection with the decision to withhold Spiegel's required financial reports to avoid issuance by its outside auditor of a ""going concern"" opinion. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The Commission's action against the Spiegel directors demonstrates that the Commission will hold those at the highest corporate ranks accountable for their conduct. Directors who keep important financial information from the investing public by purposely failing to file required financial reports will be sanctioned. Shareholders and investors deserve to know the unadulterated truth."" Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, said, ""This enforcement action demonstrates the Commission's continuing resolve to hold individuals responsible when they contribute to a company's misstatement of financial information to the investing public."" The Commission alleges in its complaints that Moran, Sievers, Zaepfel, Cannataro and Steele improperly increased inter-company fees between Spiegel's retail subsidiaries and Spiegel's bank subsidiary, which had the effect of hiding the deteriorating performance of the company's credit card receivables portfolio. Spiegel was thus able to benefit improperly from the securitization of that portfolio. The Commission also alleged that former Directors Otto, Crusemann and Hansen and former CEO Zaepfel all participated in the decision to not file Spiegel's 2001 Form 10-K and first quarter 2002 Form 10-Q on a timely basis. Prior to the deadline for the filing of the Form 10-K, Spiegel's outside auditor informed the company that a ""going concern"" opinion would accompany the filing unless Spiegel was able to resolve its underlying financial problems. When it failed to resolve those problems by the April 15, 2002 deadline, the company improperly elected to withhold its filing rather than make the required disclosures to the investing public. In light of the above, the Commission alleged that Moran, Sievers, Zaepfel, Cannataro and Steele violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violated and aided and abetted violations of various books and records and financial reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission also alleged that Otto, Crusemann and Zaepfel aided and abetted Spiegel's violations of the financial reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. Finally, the Commission alleged that Hansen was a cause of Spiegel's violations of these reporting provisions. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Moran, Sievers, Cannataro, Steele, Otto, Crusemann and Zaepfel have consented to the Court's issuance of an order of permanent injunction enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws. In addition, Moran, Sievers, Cannataro and Steele have consented to each pay a civil penalty of $120,000. Otto and Crusemann have consented to each pay a civil penalty of $100,000. Zaepfel has consented to pay a civil penalty of $170,000. Finally, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Hansen has consented to the Commission's entry of an order ordering him to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

352,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that three subsidiaries of Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. will pay $55 million to settle charges that they misrepresented and failed to disclose to fund shareholders and the funds' Boards of Directors their use of fund assets to pay for the marketing and distribution of Hartford mutual funds and annuities. The three subsidiaries, Hartford Investment Financial Services, LLC (Hartford Investment), HL Investment Advisors, LLC (HL Advisors) and Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. (Hartford Distribution) (collectively, Hartford), agreed to relinquish $40 million in ill-gotten gains and pay a $15 million penalty. The entire $55 million will be distributed to the affected Hartford funds. Linda Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Hartford told the fund investors that shareholders would not pay for the marketing and distribution of fund shares, but then used the funds' assets rather than Hartford's own assets to meet its shelf space obligations. Such misrepresentations cannot be tolerated. Our action today sends a strong message about the importance of providing proper disclosure to fund Boards and fund investors."" Merri Jo Gillette, Regional Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, added, ""Investment advisers need to make clear and complete disclosures about the use of fund assets. This settlement confirms the Commission's commitment to ensuring that mutual fund shareholders receive full and accurate information so they can make informed investment decisions."" According to an Order issued by the Commission, between 2000 and 2003, Hartford entered into arrangements with 61 broker-dealers pursuant to which it agreed to pay for special marketing and distribution benefits, known as ""shelf space."" Hartford represented to shareholders in the funds' prospectuses that it used its own assets to pay for shelf space and that shareholders did not pay for shelf space. Hartford failed to disclose that instead of using only its own assets, Hartford directed approximately $51 million of the Hartford funds' assets, in the form of brokerage commissions, to certain broker-dealers in order to satisfy some of Hartford's shelf space obligations. Hartford also failed to disclose to the funds' Boards its practice of directing the funds' brokerage commissions to broker-dealers in exchange for shelf space. By failing to disclose this practice to the Boards, Hartford Investment and HL Advisors breached their fiduciary duties to the funds' Boards and deprived the funds' Boards of the opportunity to determine the best use of fund assets. Hartford Distribution, the distributor and principal underwriter for some of the funds, aided and abetted Hartford Investment and HL Advisors violations. Despite its duty to do so, Hartford Distribution also failed to disclose these arrangements to the funds' Boards. In addition to the $55 million payment, Hartford Investment and HL Advisors were censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act. Hartford Distribution was also censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and from causing violations of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act. The Commission's Order further requires Hartford Investment, HL Advisors and Hartford Distribution to undertake certain compliance reforms.

353,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today entered an order sanctioning the City of San Diego for committing securities fraud by failing to disclose to the investing public important information about its pension and retiree health care obligations in the sale of its municipal bonds in 2002 and 2003. To settle the action, the city agreed to cease and desist from future securities fraud violations and to retain an independent consultant for three years to foster compliance with its disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""American investors trust municipal bonds as they do few other investments. With over $2.2 trillion in municipal securities outstanding â two-thirds of which are held by individual investors â municipal bonds are a vitally important segment of our nation's securities markets. This action signifies our resolve to hold state and local governments accountable when they commit fraud while seeking to borrow the public's money."" Randall R. Lee, the Regional Director of the SEC's Pacific Regional Office in Los Angeles, added, ""San Diego's misconduct jeopardized the interests of its citizens, its current and future retirees, and those who placed their trust in the City's bonds as an investment. The appointment of an independent consultant is an important step in ensuring that the City takes seriously its obligations to the investing public."" The SEC issued an Order finding that the city's disclosures about its pension and retiree health care obligations and its ability to pay those obligations were misleading. The Order finds that the city failed to disclose that the city's unfunded liability to its pension plan was projected to dramatically increase, growing from $284 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 to an estimated $2 billion by 2009, and that the city's liability for retiree health care was another estimated $1.1 billion. According to the Order, the city also failed to disclose that it had been intentionally under-funding its pension obligations so that it could increase pension benefits but defer the costs, and that it would face severe difficulty funding its future pension and retiree health care obligations unless new revenues were obtained, pension and health care benefits were reduced, or city services were cut. The Order further finds that the city knew or was reckless in not knowing that its disclosures were materially misleading. The Order finds that the city made these misleading statements through three different means. First, the city made misleading statements in the offering documents for five municipal offerings in 2002 and 2003 that raised over $260 million from investors. The offering documents containing the misleading statements included the ""official statements,"" which were intended to disclose material information to investors, and the ""preliminary official statements,"" which were used to gauge investors' interest in a bond issuance. Second, the city made misleading statements to the agencies that gave the city its credit rating for its municipal bonds. Finally, the city made misleading statements in its ""continuing disclosure statements,"" which described the city's financial condition and were provided by the city to the municipal securities market with respect to prior city bond offerings. The city's enormous pension and retiree health liabilities and its failure to disclose those liabilities placed the city in serious financial straits, according to the Order. When the city eventually disclosed its pension and retiree health care issue in fiscal year 2004, the credit rating agencies lowered the city's credit rating. The Order requires the city to cease and desist from committing violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Order also requires the city to retain an independent consultant to review and assess its policies, procedures, and internal controls about its disclosures relating to municipal bond offerings; conduct annual reviews for a three-year period of the city's policies, procedures, and internal controls and to make recommendations with a view to assuring compliance with the city's disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws; and assess the city's compliance with its policies, procedures, and internal controls, and its adoption of the consultant's recommendations. The city agreed to adopt, implement, and employ the independent consultant's recommendations or alternatives designed to achieve the same objectives. In deciding to accept the city's offer to settle this matter, the Commission considered various remedial measures that the city has already taken to detect and prevent future securities law violations, as well as the city's agreement to retain an independent consultant. The city consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying the findings in the Order.

355,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged registered broker-dealer Jefferies & Co., Inc., and two executives in connection with approximately $2 million worth of lavish gifts, extravagant travel and entertainment and other illegal gratuities given to win mutual fund trading business. Jefferies, its Director of Equities, Scott Jones, and Kevin Quinn, the firm's former Senior Vice President and equity sales trader, have agreed to the Commission's institution of settled enforcement proceedings. The Commission issued Orders that find that, in May 2002, Jefferies hired Quinn to increase Jefferies' brokerage business with a family of mutual funds managed by an adviser with which Quinn had a pre-existing relationship. To retain Quinn as an expected rainmaker, the firm gave him a highly lucrative compensation package that included a $1.5 million annual travel and entertainment budget, which Quinn used to lavish travel, entertainment and gifts on a handful of the fund adviser's most successful equity traders and the adviser's head of equity trading. The Commission's Orders find that Quinn aided and abetted the violations of the fund adviser's employees, and that Jefferies and Jones failed to supervise Quinn's misconduct. According to the Commission's Orders, Quinn provided the traders with expensive golf trips, flew them on private jets, lodged them at fancy hotels, and showered them with golf merchandise and other presents. On certain occasions, he also made private jets available to them to take on personal trips without his attendance. Quinn also gave these same traders tickets to major sporting events, Broadway shows, and concerts, again without his attendance, and even helped pay for one trader's elaborate bachelor party in Miami. The Commission's Orders further find that Jones, Quinn's primary supervisor, approved numerous expense vouchers that reflected inappropriate expenditures on behalf of the traders. The illegal conduct occurred between May 2002 and October 2004. Walter G. Ricciardi, Deputy Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""It is illegal for brokers to compensate mutual fund traders for brokerage business; the traders' loyalty and allegiance are owed solely to investors and such compensation may harm investors by impairing the traders' objective judgment. Here, Mr. Quinn lavished gifts and excessive entertainment on select equity traders to improperly sway the flow of brokerage business, and Mr. Jones and Jefferies failed to properly supervise Mr. Quinn despite providing him with an annual budget of $1.5 million for travel and entertainment."" David P. Bergers, District Administrator of the Commission's Boston District Office, added, ""Brokerage firms must monitor their employees' use of company funds to ensure they are not illegally providing compensation for brokerage business. When they fail to do so and their employees illegally provide such compensation, the Commission will hold them accountable."" The Commission's Order against Quinn finds that Quinn willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act, Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. Under the terms of the settlement, Quinn has agreed, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings or allegations, to payment of $1 of disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $468,000 to a Fair Fund for the benefit of the fund adviser's clients; a cease-and-desist order against committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act and Section17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder; a bar from association with any broker or dealer; and a prohibition from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company. The Commission's Order against Jefferies and Jones further finds that Jefferies failed reasonably to supervise Quinn, with a view to preventing and detecting Quinn's aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act. The Order also finds that Jefferies violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Jefferies has consented to the imposition of a cease-and-desist order against committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder; a censure; and payment of $4.2 million in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest. Jefferies has also agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of Jefferies= supervisory, compliance, and other policies and procedures relating to the provision of gifts, travel, and entertainment by the company and its employees. Jefferies also will pay a penalty of $5.5 million to NASD in connection with the settlement of a separate NASD proceeding based on the same underlying conduct. Finally, the Order against Jefferies and Jones finds that Jones failed reasonably to supervise Quinn, with a view to preventing and detecting Quinn's aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act. Jones has consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to payment of a civil money penalty of $50,000 and a three month suspension from acting in a supervisory capacity for any broker or dealer.

356,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained an emergency asset freeze to halt an Estonia-based ""account intrusion"" scheme that targeted online brokerage accounts in the U.S. to manipulate the markets. In an emergency federal court action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission charged Grand Logistic, S.A., a Belize corporation located in Tallinn, Estonia, and its owner, Evgeny Gashichev, a citizen of Russia, with conducting a fraudulent scheme involving the manipulation of the prices of numerous stocks by the unauthorized use of other people's online brokerage accounts (account intrusions). The Commission alleges that, between Aug. 28, and Oct. 13, 2006, Grand Logistic and Gashichev made $353,609 in unlawful profits by conducting at least 25 separate manipulations, involving the securities of at least 21 companies. Acting on the Commission's request, the Court today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the defendants' assets and orders the repatriation of funds taken out of the United States. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Account intrusions combine securities fraud, identity theft and hacking. Our action today demonstrates, once again, that the Commission will seek out and stop those who would prey on investors, in whatever manner."" Daniel M. Hawke, District Administrator of the Commission's Philadelphia District Office, stated, ""Recently, the SEC has become aware of a dramatic increase in the number of intrusions into online brokerage accounts. We have been working closely with other regulators and brokerage firms in an effort to ensure that online brokerage trading is safe and secure. Thus far, brokerage firms are typically covering the intrusion-related losses of their customers. Today's action shows that the Commission will aggressively pursue individuals and entities who seek to harm innocent investors through such conduct."" Ethiopis Tafara, Director of the SEC's Office of International Affairs, commented, ""We are working with our colleagues in Estonia and elsewhere around the world to heighten awareness of this new form of fraud and help ensure that those engaged in this illegal activity do not use international borders to escape detection and prosecution."" The Commission's complaint alleges that, to effect his ""pump and dump"" manipulations, Gashichev purchased shares of small, thinly-traded companies, with low share prices, through an online trading account he opened in the name of Grand Logistic at an Estonian financial services firm that has an omnibus account at a U.S. broker-dealer through which the defendants traded. Often within minutes of the purchase, Gashichev used electronically stolen usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized Internet access to one or more online brokerage accounts (the intruded accounts) for the sole purpose of pumping up the price of the stock he had just purchased at lower prices. He also used electronic means to hide his identity, and mask the means by which he intruded into accounts. The complaint further alleges that, without the knowledge or consent of the victimized accountholders, and using the victim's own funds, Gashichev placed orders through these intruded accounts to purchase large blocks of the same stock at artificially inflated prices -- often many times the volume of his initial purchases. These purchases created buying pressure and the false appearance of legitimate trading activity, which caused the price of the stock to greatly increase. Gashichev then sold, at a profit, the shares he had earlier purchased in the Grand Logistic account. The share prices of the manipulated stocks invariably fell sharply, and the victims suffered losses in their accounts. The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, as permanent relief, seeks permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance has issued an investor alert, which is available on the SEC's website, that provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an intrusion. See http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/onlinebrokerage.htm. The SEC and five other federal agencies have also provided valuable information concerning online investing.

357,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed settled charges against a Virginia based broker-dealer, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc. (FBR) for its unlawful insider trading, failure to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures, and unregistered sales of securities while serving as the placement agent for a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) offering by CompuDyne Corporation. Also charged today with separate violations were three of the company's former executives, Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Emanuel Friedman, Director of Compliance, Nicholas Nichols, and Head Trader, Scott Dreyer. To settle these charges, FBR consented to pay $3,755,839. Friedman and Nichols have each consented to pay $754,046 and $60,000, respectively. FBR, Friedman and Dreyer also consented to the entry of Commission orders censuring FBR and Dreyer, requiring Dreyer to pay $19,870, ordering FBR to comply with certain undertakings, and barring Friedman from association in a supervisory capacity with any broker or dealer with a right to reapply for such association after two years. The Commission's complaint filed against FBR, Friedman and Nichols alleges that FBR failed to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information in connection with the CompuDyne PIPE offering. FBR also unlawfully traded while aware of material, nonpublic information and conducted unregistered sales of securities. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Insider trading by regulated entities is completely unacceptable. Broker-dealers have an especially high duty to maintain adequate policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of the material, nonpublic information with which they are entrusted. FBR violated that duty and today's action holds the firm accountable for its conduct."" Daniel M. Hawke, District Administrator of the Commission's Philadelphia Office, stated, ""Individuals who exercise control over regulated entities will be held responsible when they fail to ensure that those entities comply with their obligations under the federal securities laws. The individuals charged in today's complaint failed to do so and are being held accountable for their failures to ensure FBR's compliance with those obligations."" The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that FBR's policies and procedures regarding the handling of material, nonpublic information were not reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of such information in the context of a PIPE offering and were not enforced by FBR, Friedman and Nichols in connection with the CompuDyne PIPE transaction in September and October 2001. These deficiencies in FBR's policies and procedures contributed to FBR's misuse of material, nonpublic information. In particular, FBR improperly traded by selling short CompuDyne securities in its market making account while aware of material, nonpublic information regarding the PIPE offering and prior to its public announcement. FBR profited by $343,773 as a result of this unlawful trading. FBR further profited from the underwriting fee of $1,764,000 that CompuDyne paid to the firm for its placement agent services. The complaint further alleges that FBR and Friedman also engaged in unregistered sales of securities in connection with the PIPE offering. In particular, FBR's head trader, consistent with Friedman's prior trading directions, bought and sold short CompuDyne securities when there was not a resale registration statement in effect for the PIPE shares and covered its net short position with CompuDyne PIPE shares FBR bought from its own customers. These transactions effectively constituted unregistered sales of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. FBR profited by an additional $97,831 as a result of these unregistered sales. As a result of the above, the complaint alleges that FBR violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, Friedman violated Section 5 of the Securities Act and is liable as a controlling person for FBR's violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Nichols is also liable as a controlling person for FBR's violation of Section 15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Commission's order finds that Dreyer violated Section 5 of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, FBR consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the court's approval, permanently enjoining it from further violations of the antifraud, registration and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Friedman and Nichols also consented to the entry of a final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and subject to the court's approval, permanently enjoining them as controlling persons from certain violations of the federal securities laws. Scott Dreyer consented to the issuance of a Commission order, without admitting or denying the order's findings, requiring him to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any registration violations. The staff coordinated its investigation with the NASD, which also announced today separate settlements with FBR, Friedman and Nichols. Daniel M. Hawke, District Administrator Elaine C.

358,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil injunctive actions against Gary C. Gerhardt, the former Chief Financial Officer of Engineered Support Systems, Inc., and Steven J. Landmann, the company's former Controller, alleging that they participated in a six-year fraudulent options backdating scheme in which they granted undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to themselves and to other Engineered Support officers, employees, and directors. According to the complaints, Engineered Support employees and directors received approximately $20 million in unauthorized compensation as a result of the backdating, $15 million of which was received by top executives and directors. Gerhardt and Landmann personally profited by $1,906,300 and $518,972 respectively. Landmann, the former Controller, settled the civil action filed against him by consenting to a permanent injunction and an officer-and-director bar, and by agreeing to pay disgorgement of $518,972, prejudgment interest of $108,099, and a civil penalty of $259,486. As part of the settlement, Landmann also consented to a permanent suspension from appearing or practicing before Commission as an accountant. Linda Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""As alleged in the complaints filed today, the executives at Engineered Support improperly increased their compensation without telling their shareholders. Our actions against Gerhardt and Landmann demonstrate the Commission's ongoing commitment to addressing fraudulent stock-option practices and ensuring full and fair disclosure of executive compensation."" Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, said, ""The complaints allege that defendants granted themselves and other Engineered Support executives millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation through their fraudulent options backdating. In this case, the improper backdating was exacerbated by the fact that the company's options vested immediately. Gerhardt and Landmann undermined the company's stated goal of using stock options to tie management's compensation to shareholder return. Instead, they granted themselves and others instant compensation that was entirely unrelated to the future performance of the company's stock."" The complaints allege that, from 1997 through 2002, Gerhardt instructed Landmann to backdate company stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of Engineered Support's common stock. The company's stock options vested at the time of grant, allowing the option recipients to obtain immediate cash profits. In addition, the complaints allege that, on at least two occasions, Gerhardt ordered Landmann to cancel previously issued Engineered Support stock options that had fallen out-of-the-money and to reissue them with new backdated grant dates and exercise prices, to bring them back in-the-money. The complaints also allege that Gerhardt directed Landmann to issue additional Engineered Support stock options to nonemployee directors in excess of authorized amounts, from which these directors received a total gain of approximately $6 million. As part of the scheme, Gerhardt and Landmann allegedly caused Engineered Support to misrepresent in its Forms 10-K and proxy statements filed with the Commission that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award. Engineered Support also failed to report the additional compensation its executives had received through in-the-money option grants. In addition, the company failed to disclose the repricing of options that had fallen out-of-the-money, or the granting of stock options to nonemployee directors in excess of authorized amounts. The complaints also allege that Gerhardt and Landmann caused Engineered Support to file materially misstated financial statements with the Commission in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the company's stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Engineered Support overstated its aggregate pretax operating income by approximately $26 million, or 21%, for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. The Commission's investigation in this matter is continuing. Merri Jo Gillette Regional Director Midwest Regional Office U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (312) 353-9338 Robert J.

362,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Kent H. Roberts, the former General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of McAfee, Inc., with securities fraud for wrongfully re-pricing McAfee stock option grants awarded to him and others in an effort to secretly increase the value of the grants. The Commission's complaint alleges that Roberts, secretly and without authorization, changed the grant date of a February 2000 grant made to him in order to take advantage of McAfee's then-declining stock price, which increased the potential value of his option grant by approximately $197,500. Roberts concealed his fraudulent re-pricing by filing false stock ownership reports with the Commission, and by failing to properly disclose in a McAfee proxy statement, which he signed, that the grant had been illicitly re-priced to confer a potential benefit of approximately $197,500 on Roberts. The complaint also alleges that in 2002, Roberts, in his capacity as secretary of the compensation committee of McAfee's board of directors, falsified the minutes of a compensation committee meeting, and directed the company to issue a 420,000 share option grant to McAfee's chief executive a day later than the committee had directed. By re-dating the grant to a day after the committee's intended grant date, Roberts gave the chief executive a potential benefit of approximately $739,200, due to an intervening decline in McAfee's stock price.

365,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 14 defendants in a brazen insider trading scheme that netted more than $15 million in illegal insider trading profits on thousands of trades, using information stolen from UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. The SEC complaint alleges that eight Wall Street professionals, including a UBS research executive and a Morgan Stanley attorney, two broker-dealers and a day-trading firm participated in the scheme. The defendants also include three hedge funds, which were the biggest beneficiaries of the fraud. ""Our action today is one of several that will make very clear the SEC is targeting hedge fund insider trading as a top priority,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. The scheme involved unlawful trading ahead of upgrades and downgrades by UBS research analysts and corporate acquisition announcements involving Morgan Stanley's investment banking clients. The ringleaders of the UBS part of the scheme went to great lengths to hide their illegal conduct, first through a clandestine meeting at Manhattan's famed Oyster Bar and eventually the use of disposable cell phones, secret codes and cash kickbacks before the scheme unraveled. ""Today's events should send a message to anyone who believes that illegal insider trading is a quick and easy way to get rich. No matter how clever you are, no matter how hard you try to avoid detection, you underestimate us at your peril,"" said SEC Enforcement Director Linda Chatman Thomsen. ""Illegal insider trading undermines the level playing field that is the hallmark of our capital markets. It is, however, particularly pernicious when Wall Street insiders â who derive their already substantial livelihood from the capital markets and those markets' investors â shamelessly compromise the markets' integrity and investors' trust for a quick buck."" SEC Associate Director of Enforcement Scott W. Friestad said, ""Today's action is one of the largest SEC insider trading cases against Wall Street professionals since the days of Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine.

We will do everything possible to make sure that, in addition to any other remedies or sanctions imposed, none of these individuals ever works in the securities industry again."" According to the SEC complaint, Mitchel Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department at UBS, provided material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to traders Eric Franklin and David Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information. Franklin and Tavdy illegally traded on this inside information personally, for the hedge funds Franklin managed, and for the registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a trader. Franklin and Tavdy also had a network of downstream tippees who illegally traded on this inside information, including a third hedge fund, a day-trading firm, and three registered representatives at Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. Several of those who illegally traded on the UBS information, and others, also traded ahead of corporate acquisition announcements using information stolen from Morgan Stanley. According to the complaint, Randi Collotta, an attorney in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, together with her husband, Christopher Collotta, an attorney in private practice, provided material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley's investment banking clients to Marc Jurman, a registered representative at a Florida broker-dealer. Jurman then traded on this information and shared his illicit profits with the Collottas. Jurman also tipped Robert Babcock, a registered representative at Bear Stearns, who traded on the information and tipped Franklin, a hedge fund managed by Franklin, and another registered representative at Bear Stearns. As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission alleges that each named defendant violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

The ringleaders of the UBS part of the scheme went to great lengths to hide their illegal conduct, first through a clandestine meeting at Manhattan's famed Oyster Bar and eventually the use of disposable cell phones, secret codes and cash kickbacks before the scheme unraveled. ""Today's events should send a message to anyone who believes that illegal insider trading is a quick and easy way to get rich. No matter how clever you are, no matter how hard you try to avoid detection, you underestimate us at your peril,"" said SEC Enforcement Director Linda Chatman Thomsen. ""Illegal insider trading undermines the level playing field that is the hallmark of our capital markets. It is, however, particularly pernicious when Wall Street insiders â who derive their already substantial livelihood from the capital markets and those markets' investors â shamelessly compromise the markets' integrity and investors' trust for a quick buck."" SEC Associate Director of Enforcement Scott W. Friestad said, ""Today's action is one of the largest SEC insider trading cases against Wall Street professionals since the days of Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine. It involves fraud by employees of some of the biggest brokerage and investment banking firms in the country. We will do everything possible to make sure that, in addition to any other remedies or sanctions imposed, none of these individuals ever works in the securities industry again."" According to the SEC complaint, Mitchel Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department at UBS, provided material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to traders Eric Franklin and David Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information. Franklin and Tavdy illegally traded on this inside information personally, for the hedge funds Franklin managed, and for the registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a trader. Franklin and Tavdy also had a network of downstream tippees who illegally traded on this inside information, including a third hedge fund, a day-trading firm, and three registered representatives at Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. Several of those who illegally traded on the UBS information, and others, also traded ahead of corporate acquisition announcements using information stolen from Morgan Stanley. According to the complaint, Randi Collotta, an attorney in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, together with her husband, Christopher Collotta, an attorney in private practice, provided material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley's investment banking clients to Marc Jurman, a registered representative at a Florida broker-dealer. Jurman then traded on this information and shared his illicit profits with the Collottas. Jurman also tipped Robert Babcock, a registered representative at Bear Stearns, who traded on the information and tipped Franklin, a hedge fund managed by Franklin, and another registered representative at Bear Stearns. As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission alleges that each named defendant violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. The Commission's complaint names the defendants and includes the allegations set forth below: The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

367,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that on Tuesday, March 6, 2007, it won an emergency court order freezing assets in a Latvian-based bank's trading account being used to conduct a hi-tech market manipulation scheme. The Commission's enforcement action is the third filed in as many months involving market manipulation schemes conducted through online account intrusions. In an emergency federal court action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Commission alleged that the account, maintained by relief defendant JSC Parex Bank based in Riga, Latvia, had been used by one or more unknown offshore sub-account holders to launch a ""pump and dump"" manipulation scheme involving the stocks of fifteen different public companies. As part of the scheme, the unknown traders hacked into unsuspecting investors' online brokerage accounts at seven different brokerage firms, selling off investors' positions and using the proceeds to pump up the market for the stocks subject to the scheme. Through this technique, the unknown traders generated at least $732,941 in illicit profits and cost U.S. brokerages some $2 million in losses. In response to the Commission's motion, the Court issued a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' fraudulent profits held in JSC Parex's omnibus trading account. SEC Enforcement Deputy Director Peter Bresnan stated, ""In today's global economy, where con artists can misuse computer technology to defraud innocent U.S. investors from far beyond our borders, freezing the unlawful profits of those behind these intrusion schemes is especially important. Working to prevent injury to U.S. investors from intrusions into online brokerage accounts is a top priority of the Enforcement Division."" ""Using sophisticated computer hacking and identity theft techniques to break into the accounts of innocent online brokerage customers,"" said SEC Office of Internet Enforcement Chief John Reed Stark, ""these perpetrators effectively cut out the middleman of the old fashioned pump-and-dump scheme, eliminating phony stock promotions, creating their own artificial trading demand, and consummating their frauds in as little time as a couple of hours."" The Commission's complaint alleges a complex scheme that combines electronic intrusions into online brokerage accounts with a traditional market manipulation. From at least December 2005 through December 2006, one or more foreign-based unknown traders purchased, through four sub-accounts of an omnibus trading account titled in the name of Relief Defendant JSC Parex Bank and held at Pinnacle Capital Markets LLC of North Carolina, shares in 15 U.S.-based Nasdaq-traded companies. These unknown traders then hacked into unsuspecting investors' online brokerage accounts at seven major online broker-dealers and sold off investors' existing securities holdings. They then used the proceeds to buy shares on the open market of the thinly traded issuers the unknown traders had previously purchased in their own sub-accounts. This illicit account activity artificially heightened the share price and trading volume for each of the thinly traded issues and enabled the unknown traders to sell their holdings at a substantial profit, realizing at least $732,941 in ill-gotten gains, and possibly more. The unknown traders also used electronic means to hide their identities and mask the means by which they intruded into accounts. The Commission's complaint further alleges that the unknown traders violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations by the unknown traders, and disgorgement of all the unknown traders' ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks a final judgment requiring Parex to disgorge any assets it may have obtained as a result of the unknown traders' scheme. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance has issued an investor alert, which is available on the SEC's website, that provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an intrusion.

368,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has settled its enforcement action against F. David Radler, the former Deputy Chairman and COO of Hollinger International, Inc., pending in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois. Under the terms of the settlement, Radler is Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Radler and others misappropriated millions of dollars from Hollinger International and made numerous misstatements to shareholders as part of their scheme. The tough sanctions in this settlement, including one of the largest civil penalties in recent years against an individual wrongdoer, reflect our resolve to act forcefully against corporate officers who perpetrate fraud against those whom they were supposed to serve, the shareholders of the company."" Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office, said, ""Officers who steal from the company coffers have no place in the boardroom. In this case, Radler participated in a scheme to divert millions for his own benefit at the expense of public shareholders. As a result of his misconduct, Radler will be barred from ever again serving as an officer or director of a public company. "" On Nov. 15, 2004, the Commission filed its action against Radler, Conrad M. Black, Hollinger International's former Chairman and CEO, and Hollinger, Inc., Hollinger International's controlling shareholder, alleging that from approximately 1999 through 2003, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to divert cash and assets from Hollinger International, Inc., through a series of related party transactions. The Commission's complaint alleges, among other things, that Black and Radler diverted to themselves, other corporate insiders and Hollinger, Inc. approximately $85 million of the proceeds from Hollinger International's sale of newspaper publications through purported ""non-competition"" payments. The complaint also alleges that Black and Radler orchestrated the sale of certain of Hollinger International's newspaper publications at below-market prices to another privately-held company owned and controlled by Black and Radler, including the sale of one publication for $1.00. The complaint further alleges that in order to perpetrate their fraudulent scheme, Black and Radler misled Hollinger International's Audit Committee and Board of Directors concerning the related party transactions and also misrepresented and omitted to state material facts regarding these transactions in Hollinger International's filings with the Commission and during shareholder meetings. Radler, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment which permanently enjoins him from violations of Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, and, as a control person, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

369,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today issued a settled cease-and-desist order against American Stock Exchange LLC for failing to enforce compliance with securities laws and rules and failing to comply with its record-keeping obligations. In the order, the Commission found that from at least 1999 through June 2004, the Amex failed adequately to surveil for violations of order handling rules by Amex members and failed to keep and furnish surveillance and other records. In addition, the Commission instituted contested administrative proceedings against Salvatore F. Sodano, the Amex's former chairman and chief executive officer, alleging that he failed to enforce compliance with federal securities laws and exchange rules by Amex members and persons associated with those members. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Enforcing compliance with federal securities laws, and a self-regulatory organization's own rules, is a central function of a self-regulatory organization. Today's action against the Amex demonstrates that the Commission will be vigilant in making certain that SROs fulfill their regulatory responsibilities."" SEC Associate Director Scott W. Friestad said, ""Senior management of a self-regulatory organization play a critical role in establishing a culture of compliance and are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the organization is meeting its regulatory objectives. Our action against Mr. Sodano alleges that he improperly abdicated his oversight responsibilities and ignored repeated red flags regarding the Amex's regulatory deficiencies."" In its order against the Amex, the Commission found that, from at least 1999, the Amex was on notice that its surveillance, investigatory, and enforcement programs were inadequate. The Amex previously had consented to the issuance of a Sept. 11, 2000, order that, in part, directed the Amex to enhance and improve its regulatory programs for surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of the options order handling rules. The Commission found that, notwithstanding the September 2000 order, the Amex's surveillance programs for options order handling remained inadequate to detect violations of firm quote, customer priority, limit order display, and trade reporting, and other rules. When the Amex's surveillance programs detected rule violations, the Amex failed to investigate violations properly, improperly excused violations, and failed to pursue adequately disciplinary actions for rule violations. The Commission also found that as late as June 2004, the Amex had similar deficiencies in its surveillance for equity order handling and floor broker violations. In addition to the deficiencies in the Amex's surveillance, investigatory, and enforcement programs, the Commission found that the Amex failed to keep and furnish certain records relating to its surveillance, investigatory, and enforcement activities and further furnished the Commission with inaccurate documents. Pursuant to the order, the Commission censured the Amex and ordered it to cease and desist from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 19(g)(1) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17a-1. The Commission further ordered the Amex to comply with undertakings (1) to file a rule proposal with the Commission to enhance its trading systems so that specialists systemically will be prevented from violating the Amex's customer priority rules; (2) to enhance the Amex's training programs so that floor members and members of the Amex's regulatory staff responsible for surveillance, investigation, and regulation will be required to receive annual training related to compliance with federal securities laws and Amex rules; and (3) to retain an auditor to conduct three biennial audits of the Amex's surveillance, examination, and disciplinary programs related to trading. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Amex consented to the issuance of the Commission's order. In the separate, related proceeding against Sodano, the former chairman and CEO of the Amex, the Division of Enforcement alleged that the Amex's regulatory failures resulted in large part from Sodano's failures to make regulation an Amex priority, to pay adequate attention to regulation, to put in place an oversight structure to monitor compliance, to ensure that regulatory staff was properly trained, and to dedicate sufficient resources to regulation. These failures were particularly significant with respect to the Amex's options market because Sodano knew the Amex had been previously sanctioned by the Commission for its inadequate options regulation in the September 2000 order and that the Commission had ordered the Amex to enhance and improve its regulatory programs for surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of the options order handling rules. The proceedings instituted today against Sodano, pursuant to Section 19(h) of the Exchange Act, will determine whether Sodano failed, without reasonable justification or excuse, to enforce compliance with the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, and Amex rules, by members of the Amex and persons associated with those members. In a third, related proceeding, the Commission issued an order against Richard Robinson, a former Amex vice president responsible for overseeing the Amex's regulatory surveillance programs for the derivatives and options markets. The Commission found that Robinson was a cause of the Amex's violations by failing to oversee properly the Amex's surveillance program for derivatives and options, by failing to maintain properly Amex investigative files, and by signing and submitting an affirmation to the Commission on behalf of the Amex that contained inaccurate representations relating to the Amex's regulatory program. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Robinson consented to the issuance of an order directing him to cease-and-desist from causing violation of Sections 17(a)(1) and 19(g)(1) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17a-1.",-0.5,Negative
370,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against auto parts manufacturer Collins & Aikman Corporation (C&A), David A. Stockman, C&A's former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and eight other former C&A directors and officers. The SEC's complaint alleges that between 2001 and 2005, Stockman personally directed fraudulent schemes to inflate C&A's reported income by accounting improperly for supplier payments. In furtherance of those schemes, the complaint alleges that Stockman and other defendants obtained false documents from suppliers designed to mislead C&A's external auditors. According to the complaint, when aspects of the schemes were discovered in March 2005, Stockman embarked on a public campaign to mislead investors, potential financiers and others by minimizing the extent of the fraudulent accounting and hiding C&A's dire financial condition. The other former officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller, and Treasurer, and a former member of C&A's Board of Directors, are alleged to have participated in the accounting schemes or the campaign to mislead investors. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""This case demonstrates again that the Commission will take strong action when a company and its officers are alleged to have engaged in accounting fraud to inflate the company's reported operating results. The conduct we allege here is especially egregious because Stockman and the other defendants not only repeatedly engaged in fraud, but went to great efforts to cover-up their misconduct, and the company's financial difficulties, from investors, analysts and others."" Christopher Conte, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, said, ""The facts here are particularly troubling because of the number of fraudulent transactions C&A engaged in, the length of time over which they occurred, and the number of C&A employees, including a large number of senior officers, who carried out the fraudulent conduct, as alleged in our complaint. Moreover, during the same period in which we allege Stockman was defrauding investors, he was collecting millions of dollars of the management fees C&A paid to Stockman's private equity fund, Heartland Industrial Partners."" In addition to Stockman, the other former C&A directors and officers charged in the complaint are The complaint charges violations of the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, certification and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions, officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The Commission's complaint alleges that between late 2001 and early 2005, the defendants engaged in multiple fraudulent schemes and made materially false and misleading statements concerning C&A's financial condition and operating results in, among other things, filings with the Commission, offering documents, and press releases. The allegations include the following. C&A simultaneously settled the charges, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Regarding the settled action against the company, Mr. Conte stated, ""C&A took significant remedial steps and cooperated extensively with the Commission's investigation. Consistent with the principles announced in the Commission's January 2006 Statement Concerning Financial Penalties, the Commission considered C&A's remediation and cooperation, among other things, in deciding not to impose a penalty."" Today the U.S Attorney's Office for the Southern District announced parallel indictments against Stockman and others.

371,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges in federal district court against Tenet Healthcare Corporation and its former chief financial officer and co-president, its former chief operating officer and co-president, its former general counsel and chief compliance officer, and its former chief accounting officer for failing to disclose to investors that Tenet's strong earnings growth from 1999 to 2002 was driven largely by its exploitation of a loophole in the Medicare reimbursement system. Once Tenet finally revealed its scheme to the investing public and admitted that its strategy was not sustainable, the market value of Tenet's stock plunged by over $11 billion. During the relevant time, Tenet was based in Santa Barbara, Calif., and was the second largest publicly traded healthcare company in the United States. To settle the charges, Tenet agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10 million. The SEC will seek to have these funds placed into a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Tenet also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to Tenet, the SEC's complaint names Thomas B. Mackey, age 58, of Keswick, Va., Tenet's former chief operating officer and co-president; Christi R. Sulzbach, age 52, of Santa Barbara, Calif., the former general counsel and chief compliance officer; David L. Dennis, age 58, of Los Angeles, the former chief financial officer and co-president; and Raymond L. Mathiasen, age 63, of Los Angeles, the former chief accounting officer. Dennis and Mathiasen have agreed to settle the Commission's charges. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""Companies must explain their financial performance in a manner that enables investors to see the company as management does. Today's action shows our commitment to holding companies and their executives accountable when they fail to communicate with investors in a clear and straightforward manner or fail to provide them with honest information."" Randall R. Lee, Director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, said, ""By exploiting a loophole in Medicare regulations, Tenet embarked on an unsustainable strategy to turbocharge its earnings. Yet even as Tenet's strategy produced nearly half of its earnings per share, Tenet's management kept investors in the dark about the central business strategy underlying its earnings growth."" The Commission's complaint alleges that between 1999 and 2002, Tenet engaged in an unsustainable strategy to reach its earnings targets by deliberately exploiting the Medicare reimbursement system. Tenet's scheme involved a loophole in the Medicare reimbursement system related to ""outlier payments,"" which are designed to compensate hospitals for caring for extraordinarily sick Medicare patients. Tenet's management realized that Tenet could inflate its revenue from outlier payments by simply increasing the gross charges set by its hospitals. From 1999 to 2002, Tenet's outlier revenue more than tripled and Tenet's earnings goals were surpassed year after year. Tenet's outlier growth from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2002 accounted for over 54% of its cumulative growth in earnings per share from operations. Similarly, by fiscal 2002, Tenet's outlier revenue comprised over 40% of its earnings per share. The complaint alleges that Tenet, acting through Dennis, Mathiasen, Mackey, and Sulzbach, misled the investing public by failing to disclose Tenet's strategy, its impact on revenues and earnings, and its unsustainability in the portion of its public filings with the Commission known as ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" commonly referred to as MD&A. In part as a result of its outlier scheme, Tenet received enough income to set aside funds in improper general reserves. Tenet, with Mathiasen's approval, created general reserves totaling approximately $107 million by the end of Tenet's 2002 fiscal year. These inappropriate reserves resulted in material misstatements to Tenet's financial statements for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Mathiasen and Dennis each agreed to settle the Commission's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Mathiasen agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, to pay a civil penalty of $240,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. A certified public accountant, Mathiasen also agreed to be permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's rules of practice. Dennis agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay a $150,000 civil penalty. The penalties paid by Mathiasen and Dennis personally will also be added to the Fair Fund for investors along with Tenet's payment. The Commission's complaint charges Mackey and Sulzbach with violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions, orders barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. On March 30, 2006, the Commission charged three of Tenet's outside auditors with improperly changing audit work papers in connection with the audit completed during the period of the defendants' scheme.

372,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against two former senior executives of Apple, Inc. in a matter involving improper stock option backdating. The Commission accused former General Counsel Nancy R. Heinen of participating in the fraudulent backdating of options granted to Apple's top officers that caused the company to underreport its expenses by nearly $40 million. The Commission's complaint alleges that Heinen, of Portola Valley, Calif., caused Apple to backdate two large options grants to senior executives of Apple â a February 2001 grant of 4.8 million options to Apple's Executive Team and a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs â and altered company records to conceal the fraud. The Commission also filed, and simultaneously settled, charges against former Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred D. Anderson, of Atherton, Calif., alleging that Anderson should have noticed Heinen's efforts to backdate the Executive Team grant but failed to take steps to ensure that Apple's financial statements were correct. As part of the settlement, Anderson agreed (without admitting or denying the allegations) to pay approximately $3.5 million in disgorgement and penalties. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, stated, ""The Apple case demonstrates the Commission's ongoing commitment to take action against stock options backdating and other executive compensation abuses. When corporate officers enrich themselves at the expense of a company's shareholders, the Commission will hold the responsible individuals accountable, particularly where, as here, the responsible individuals are among those obligated to ensure that the company complies with all applicable securities laws and that its financial statements are accurate."" Marc J. Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, stated, ""Apple's shareholders relied on Heinen and Anderson, as respected legal and accounting professionals, to ensure the accurate reporting of the company's executive compensation. Instead, they failed in their duties as gatekeepers and caused Apple to conceal millions of dollars in stock option expenses."" According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Apple granted 4.8 million options to six members of its executive team (including Heinen and Anderson) in February 2001. Because the options were in-the-money when granted (i.e. could be exercised to purchase Apple shares at a below market price), Apple was required to report a compensation charge in its publicly filed financial statements. The Commission alleges that, in order to avoid reporting this expense, Heinen caused Apple to backdate options to January 17, 2001, when Apple's share price was substantially lower. Heinen is also alleged to have directed her staff to prepare documents falsely indicating that Apple's Board had approved the Executive Team grant on January 17. As a result, Apple failed to record approximately $18.9 million in compensation expenses associated with the option grant. Anderson, who should have realized the implications of Heinen's actions, failed to disclose key information to Apple's auditors and neglected to ensure that the company's financial statements were accurate. Both Heinen and Anderson personally received millions of dollars in unreported compensation as a result of the backdating. The Commission's complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs. Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen â as with the Executive Team grant â caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apple's share price was lower. As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant. The Commission further alleges that Heinen then signed fictitious Board minutes stating that the Board had approved the grant to Jobs on October 19 at a ""Special Meeting of the Board of Directors"" â a meeting that, in fact, never occurred. Heinen is charged with, among other things, violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, lying to Apple's auditors, and violating prohibitions on circumventing internal controls. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and money penalties against Heinen, in addition to an order barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Anderson, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud, reporting, internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Anderson also will disgorge approximately $3.49 million in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, representing the in-the-money portion of the Executive Team options grant that Anderson exercised, and will pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Apple based in part on its swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation. Apple's cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.

The Commission's complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs. Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen â as with the Executive Team grant â caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apple's share price was lower. As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant. The Commission further alleges that Heinen then signed fictitious Board minutes stating that the Board had approved the grant to Jobs on October 19 at a ""Special Meeting of the Board of Directors"" â a meeting that, in fact, never occurred. Heinen is charged with, among other things, violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, lying to Apple's auditors, and violating prohibitions on circumventing internal controls. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and money penalties against Heinen, in addition to an order barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Anderson, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud, reporting, internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Anderson also will disgorge approximately $3.49 million in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, representing the in-the-money portion of the Executive Team options grant that Anderson exercised, and will pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Apple based in part on its swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation. Apple's cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.

374,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against two former senior executives of Apple, Inc. in a matter involving improper stock option backdating. The Commission accused former General Counsel Nancy R. Heinen of participating in the fraudulent backdating of options granted to Apple's top officers that caused the company to underreport its expenses by nearly $40 million. The Commission's complaint alleges that Heinen, of Portola Valley, Calif., caused Apple to backdate two large options grants to senior executives of Apple â a February 2001 grant of 4.8 million options to Apple's Executive Team and a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs â and altered company records to conceal the fraud. The Commission also filed, and simultaneously settled, charges against former Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred D. Anderson, of Atherton, Calif., alleging that Anderson should have noticed Heinen's efforts to backdate the Executive Team grant but failed to take steps to ensure that Apple's financial statements were correct. As part of the settlement, Anderson agreed (without admitting or denying the allegations) to pay approximately $3.5 million in disgorgement and penalties. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, stated, ""The Apple case demonstrates the Commission's ongoing commitment to take action against stock options backdating and other executive compensation abuses. When corporate officers enrich themselves at the expense of a company's shareholders, the Commission will hold the responsible individuals accountable, particularly where, as here, the responsible individuals are among those obligated to ensure that the company complies with all applicable securities laws and that its financial statements are accurate."" Marc J. Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, stated, ""Apple's shareholders relied on Heinen and Anderson, as respected legal and accounting professionals, to ensure the accurate reporting of the company's executive compensation. Instead, they failed in their duties as gatekeepers and caused Apple to conceal millions of dollars in stock option expenses."" According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Apple granted 4.8 million options to six members of its executive team (including Heinen and Anderson) in February 2001. Because the options were in-the-money when granted (i.e. could be exercised to purchase Apple shares at a below market price), Apple was required to report a compensation charge in its publicly filed financial statements. The Commission alleges that, in order to avoid reporting this expense, Heinen caused Apple to backdate options to January 17, 2001, when Apple's share price was substantially lower. Heinen is also alleged to have directed her staff to prepare documents falsely indicating that Apple's Board had approved the Executive Team grant on January 17. As a result, Apple failed to record approximately $18.9 million in compensation expenses associated with the option grant. Anderson, who should have realized the implications of Heinen's actions, failed to disclose key information to Apple's auditors and neglected to ensure that the company's financial statements were accurate. Both Heinen and Anderson personally received millions of dollars in unreported compensation as a result of the backdating. The Commission's complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs. Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen â as with the Executive Team grant â caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apple's share price was lower. As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant.

375,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled enforcement action charging Baker Hughes Incorporated, a Houston, Texas-based global provider of oil field products and services, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In the same complaint, the SEC also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA. Fearnley has not reached any settlement with the Commission regarding these charges. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Baker Hughes committed widespread and egregious violations of the FCPA while subject to a prior Commission cease-and-desist Order. The $10 million penalty demonstrates that companies must adhere to Commission Orders and that recidivists will be punished."" Christopher R. Conte, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Companies like Baker Hughes will be held accountable when they circumvent the rules of fair play and honest competition by making improper payments to win business."" The SEC's complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2 million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstan's national oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the company. Baker Hughes retained the agent principally at the urging of Fearnley. According to the complaint, Fearnley told his bosses that the ""agent for Kazakhoil"" told him that unless the agent was retained, Baker Hughes could ""say goodbye to this and future business."" Baker Hughes engaged the agent and was awarded an oil services contract in the Karachaganak oil field in Kazakhstan that generated more than $219 million in gross revenues from 2001 through 2006. Baker Hughes, the complaint alleges, paid the agent $4.1 million to its bank account in London but received no identifiable services from the agent. The complaint also alleges that in 1998 Baker Hughes retained a second agent in connection with the award of a large chemical contract with KazTransOil, the national oil transportation operator of Kazakhstan. Between 1998 and 1999, Baker Hughes paid over $1 million to the agent's Swiss bank account, despite a company employee knowing by December 1998 that the agent's representative was a high-ranking executive of KazTransOil. The SEC's complaint against Baker Hughes also alleges violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In addition to violating the FCPA, certain of this conduct occurred after September 12, 2001, and consequently violated the Commission's 2001 cease-and-desist Order. Specifically, the complaint alleges that between 1998 and 2005, Baker Hughes made payments in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in circumstances that reflected a failure to implement sufficient internal controls to determine whether the payments were for legitimate services, whether the payments would be shared with government officials, or whether these payments would be accurately recorded in Baker Hughes' books and records. For example, the complaint alleges that Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Baker Hughes consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and ordering it to pay a civil penalty and disgorgement with prejudgment interest; and to retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA policies and procedures. The Commission acknowledges Baker Hughes' cooperation in the investigation. In a related criminal proceeding announced today, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against Baker Hughes and its wholly-owned subsidiary Baker Hughes Services International, Inc., with an office in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Baker Hughes Services International, Inc. entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Gray H. Miller, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas, and agreed to plead guilty to one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one count of aiding and abetting the falsification of the books and records of Baker Hughes, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and to pay a criminal fine of $11 million. The Department of Justice has also entered into an agreement with Baker Hughes to defer prosecution for two years on charges of violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA. Under the agreement, the company will retain for a period of three years a monitor to review and assess the company's compliance program and monitor its implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and procedures. The staff acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. The staff also acknowledges the help provided, in the form of mutual legal assistance, by the Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission, HM Procureur (Attorney General) for Guernsey, and by the authorities of the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

376,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Hafiz Naseem, an investment banker with Credit Suisse (USA) LLC, with illegally divulging non-public information to a person believed to be a banker in Pakistan concerning the leveraged buyout of TXU Corp. by an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Texas Pacific Group. Naseem misappropriated the information from his employer, Credit Suisse, which served as a financial advisor to TXU in connection with the buyout. The Commission originally filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on March 2, 2007, alleging insider trading ahead of the TXU buyout against Certain Unknown Purchasers of TXU Call Options. Today, the Commission amended its complaint to name Naseem as a defendant. The Commission's Second Amended Complaint alleges that Naseem, in breach of his duty to Credit Suisse and its client TXU, telephoned the Pakistani banker on several occasions in February 2007 and disclosed non-public, material information about the proposed but unannounced TXU buyout. The Pakistani banker allegedly traded on the inside information provided by Naseem and reaped millions of dollars in profits when the buyout was publicly announced. In addition to tipping at least one of the traders in the TXU case, the SEC alleges that Naseem tipped the Pakistani banker and possibly others concerning eight additional mergers or business deals since joining Credit Suisse's New York office in March 2006. ""The SEC has made insider trading ahead of mergers and acquisitions one of its top priorities,"" said Linda Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Naseem's illicit insider trading activities ahead of the TXU buyout transaction, and eight other merger transactions, demonstrate both the complex nature of insider trading and the SEC's aggressive pursuit of people who commit such violations, no matter where in the world the evidence may lead. The Commission will continue its aggressive efforts to seek out and punish every wrongdoer in the TXU case and in any other instance of insider trading."" Rose L. Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, said, ""Naseem seriously abused his position of trust with Credit Suisse and its clients by blatantly stealing market-moving information. Through his insider trading activities, Naseem schemed to line his own pockets, as well as the pockets of others, with unlawful profits to the detriment of innocent shareholders."" Katherine S. Addleman, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ""This action and the continuing investigation into the tipping by Naseem is a remarkable example of the public and private sector working together to unravel a complex web of international insider trading. The SEC is especially appreciative of the tremendous assistance provided by Credit Suisse in the process of identifying Naseem and the cooperation afforded by the NYSE, Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom in helping to piece together evidence from across the globe, such as phone and brokerage records, to uncover Naseem's unlawful insider trading."" According to the SEC's complaint, after receiving the insider information from Naseem, the Pakistani banker purchased 6,700 TXU call option contracts with March 2007 expiration dates through UBS AG London, and made profits of approximately $5 million following public announcement of the buyout. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Naseem also divulged pending, but unannounced, business combinations and deals involving eight other issuers: Hydril Company, Trammell Crow Co., John Harland Co., Energy Partners Ltd., Veritas DGC Inc., Jacuzzi Brands, Caremark Rx, Inc., and Northwestern Corporation. The complaint notes that Credit Suisse served as an investment banker or financial advisor in all of these deals, and Naseem's phone calls from his work phone to the Pakistani banker's home and cell phones were made immediately before announcements of the proposed deals. The complaint alleges that the Pakistani banker also purchased securities in those companies in advance of public merger announcements, obtaining additional profits of more than $2.4 million. According to the SEC's complaint, Naseem opened a brokerage account in Pakistan in May 2006 and granted the Pakistani banker trading authority over that account to conceal his personal financial benefit from his misappropriations. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and money penalties against Naseem. In its complaint, the SEC also identified another previously unidentified trader who purchased in advance of the public announcement regarding TXU. The SEC alleges that Francisco Javier Garcia, believed to be a resident of Switzerland, purchased TXU securities through an omnibus account at Fimat Frankfurt and is believed to have done so on inside information.

378,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled fraud charges against Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) for its failure to provide best execution to certain retail orders for over-the-counter (OTC) securities. In particular, Morgan Stanley embedded undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs on certain retail OTC orders processed by its automated market-making system and delayed the execution of other retail OTC orders, for which Morgan Stanley had an obligation to execute without hesitation. Morgan Stanley will pay $7,957,200 in disgorgement and penalties to settle the Commission's charges. All of Morgan Stanley's revenue from its undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs will be distributed back to the injured investors through a distribution plan. ?By recklessly programming its order execution system to receive amounts that should have gone to retail customers, Morgan Stanley violated its duty of best execution and defrauded its customers,? said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission?s Division of Enforcement. ?The duty to provide best execution is a fundamental duty of a broker-dealer. Broker-dealers must be diligent in their efforts to seek the most favorable terms for their customers? orders.? Elaine C. Greenberg, Associate Regional Director of the Commission's Philadelphia Regional Office, stated, ""The duty of best execution is not a static concept, but rather one that evolves with changes in technology. No matter what technology is used, broker-dealers must take care to ensure that orders are executed properly and in accordance with the duty to provide best execution."" From Oct. 24, 2001, through Dec. 8, 2004, Morgan Stanley, a registered broker-dealer, failed to seek to obtain best execution for certain orders for OTC securities placed by retail customers of Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley DW, Inc. and third party broker-dealers that routed orders to Morgan Stanley for execution. As a result of this conduct, Morgan Stanley breached its duty of best execution with respect to these retail customers' orders. Morgan Stanley failed to provide best execution to more than 1.2 million executions valued at approximately $8 billion. Morgan Stanley recognized revenue of $5,949,222 through its improper use of undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs. As a result, Morgan Stanley willfully violated Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits broker-dealers from using manipulative, deceptive or fraudulent devices or contrivances to effect securities transactions. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Morgan Stanley consented to the entry of an Order by the Commission that censures Morgan Stanley, and requires it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Order also requires Morgan Stanley to pay disgorgement of $5,949,222 and prejudgment interest thereon of $507,978, and imposes a civil money penalty of $1.5 million.

The Commission does not allege that Balkenhol's wife knew about Balkenhol's illicit trades. Rather, the complaint alleges that Balkenhol breached a duty not to misuse confidences gleaned from his wife for his own gain. The SEC's Director of Enforcement, Linda Chatman Thomsen, said, ""Combating trading ahead of mergers and acquisitions is among the Commission's highest priorities. This case adds to a growing list of recent SEC enforcement actions against corporate employees and securities industry professionals for trading on information about upcoming corporate transactions that they knew to be confidential. Illegal insider trading undermines the level playing field that is the hallmark of our capital markets and the SEC will continue to pursue these matters vigorously."" Helane L. Morrison, Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""Spouses and close family members of highly-placed corporate employees will sometimes learn important information about the company that they know is confidential. In these situations, the family members have a duty to refrain from using the information for personal gain in the stock market."" The complaint alleges that Balkenhol engaged in pattern of insider trading by purchasing stock in Oracle acquisition targets before any public announcement of Oracle's interest. Balkenhol's first profitable trade came on March 1, 2005, when he invested $85,000 in Minneapolis-based Retek Inc. the day after Oracle executives began considering a tender offer for Retek. When Oracle announced the tender offer the following week, Retek's stock price jumped and Balkenhol sold the shares for approximately $15,000 in alleged unlawful profits. Balkenhol allegedly continued his pattern of insider trading with a series of stock purchases in another acquisition target, Siebel Systems, Inc., during Oracle's negotiations to acquire the company in 2005. On June 9, 2005, the day after Oracle's two co-Presidents secretly met with Siebel's CEO to initiate merger discussions, Balkenhol bought over $270,000 worth of Siebel's stock. Over the next three months, Balkenhol made three additional purchases of Siebel stock, each following a critical advance in the confidential negotiations. Again, Balkenhol's wife had access to detailed inside information relating to each such advance. From June to September, Balkenhol ultimately purchased over 50,000 shares of Siebel stock for a total of approximately $448,000. Immediately after Oracle's Sept. 12, 2005, announcement of its acquisition of Siebel, Balkenhol sold his entire position for approximately $82,000 in unlawful profits. The total of approximately $198,000 Balkenhol agreed to pay in settlement of the Commission's action includes $97,282 in disgorgement, $4,115 in prejudgment interest and a $97,282 civil penalty.

382,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Wall Street executive and three other individuals with securities fraud for perpetrating a decade-long scheme to defraud savings banks and their depositors in connection with the banks' conversion from mutual to stock ownership. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bert Fingerhut spearheaded a sophisticated scheme to circumvent federal and state banking regulations in order to make lucrative stock purchases in bank conversions. From January 1997 through January 2007, Bert Fingerhut's scheme generated a total of more than $12 million in fraudulent profits from secondary market sales of bank stock illegally obtained in 65 public offerings. The other three defendants were nominees for Bert Fingerhut who knowingly played active roles in implementing the scheme and profited from their efforts: Robert Danetz, a childhood friend of Bert Fingerhut; Bruce Fingerhut, Bert Fingerhut's nephew; and Stephen Danetz, Robert Danetz's brother. The complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations in stock subscription agreements and order forms to carry out their fraudulent scheme. The complaint also alleges that Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut acted as undisclosed nominees and used phony identification cards and other documents in order to deceive the banks. All four of the defendants have agreed to settle the SEC charges. Mark K. Schonfeld, Director of the Commission's New York Regional Office, said, ""When banks convert from mutual ownership by their depositors to stock ownership by shareholders, the depositors are supposed to get first priority to purchase stock. Here, the defendants defrauded banks and depositors around the country and, in effect, jumped ahead of that line. As a result, they lined their pockets with money that should have gone to legitimate depositors. Spanning 10 years and 65 stock offerings, this is the most extensive bank conversion fraud we have ever seen."" David Rosenfeld, Associate Regional Director of the New York Regional Office, said, ""The conduct in this case was particularly egregious. The defendants ran this scheme as a shrewdly calculated business enterprise, serially defrauding banks and reaping millions in illegal profits at the expense of innocent depositors."" The defendants named in the Commission's complaint are: Bert Fingerhut, age 63, a resident of both Aspen, Colo. and Palo Alto, Calif. From 1965 through 1983, he was associated in different capacities with Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (""Oppenheimer""), then a registered broker-dealer. Among other positions, he was Director of Research and Executive Vice President and a member of both the Management and Executive Committees of Oppenheimer. From 1983 through 1988, he worked as an analyst for Odyssey Investors, Inc., a registered broker-dealer formerly affiliated with Oppenheimer. Robert Danetz, age 62, and a resident of both Teaneck, N.J. and Roxbury, N.Y. He is a retired school teacher. Bruce Fingerhut, age 38, and a resident of Alexandria, Va. He is a freelance opinion poll researcher. Stephen Danetz, age 65, and a resident of New York, N.Y. He is a real estate attorney. The Commission's complaint alleges as follows: The defendants deliberately evaded these and other applicable banking regulations and offering terms contained in the converting banks' prospectuses that imposed maximum purchase limits and prohibited the transfer of depositors' purchase rights. These priority purchase rights allow the depositors to purchase up to a certain number of shares at a relatively low price, and shares are allocated among depositors according to various criteria if an offering is oversubscribed. To ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority purchase rights, federal and state banking regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of their purchase rights or from entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering. Bert Fingerhut funded the opening of accounts in his own name and the names of his nominees at mutual savings banks throughout the country. When any of the banks undertook a conversion, he secretly funded his nominees' stock purchases, controlled the sale of his nominees' shares and retained most of the trading profits. He also had the nominees submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified to the banks that they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer the shares or the proceeds of their sale. Bert Fingerhut caused his nominees to make these material misrepresentations in 65 public stock offerings by banks. The 65 offerings were oversubscribed, and the defendants' misconduct therefore limited the amount of stock available to legitimate depositors, some of whom received less stock than they requested or were completely shut out. Bert Fingerhut and his nominees made over $12 million from the scheme at the expense of other depositors. Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut knowingly played key roles in carrying out the scheme, and reaped large profits of their own from their misconduct. They did most of the legwork to set up the nominee accounts and acted as nominees in numerous offerings. For years, they traveled the country opening as many accounts as possible, sometimes using phony identification cards and bogus utility bills to satisfy certain banks' in-state residency requirements. As nominees, they both knowingly made misrepresentations in each of the subscription agreements they signed. Stephen Danetz, a lawyer, also willingly participated as a nominee for Bert Fingerhut and knowingly made misrepresentations in one of the most profitable conversions targeted by the scheme. In addition, he was involved in discussions with Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz that led Robert Danetz to make false statements to the Commission's staff in an earlier investigation into a similar, unrelated scheme that targeted the conversion of NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. The United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey (""USAO"") has filed criminal charges against Bert Fingerhut for the same conduct. Earlier today, Bert Fingerhut pled guilty to the criminal charges and, in connection with his guilty plea, agreed to pay a total of $11 million in forfeiture, representing his own illegal profits from the scheme. All four of the defendants in the civil case have agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, to the entry of permanent antifraud injunctions. In addition, Bruce Fingerhut will disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $181,269, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000. Stephen Danetz will disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $137,975, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000. Because Bert Fingerhut has already agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the SEC case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains. The Commission's claims for civil penalties against Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz will remain pending. The Commission's investigation is ongoing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

383,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled administrative charges against Hewlett-Packard Company for failing to disclose the reasons for a directors abrupt resignation in the midst of HPs controversial investigation into boardroom leaks. The Commission found that several months before the public revelation of the companys leak investigation, an HP director objected to the companys handling of the matter and resigned from the Board, yet HP failed to disclose the reasons for his resignation as required by federal securities laws. As described in the Commissions order, in early 2006 HP initiated an investigation into leaks of confidential information about HP Board meetings to the press. By April, HP investigators had concluded one of HPs directors was responsible, and the companys Chairman and several senior executives decided to present the findings to the Board. During the course of a lengthy and heated Board meeting on May 18, 2006, the Board voted to ask the director to resign. According to the Commission, fellow Board member Thomas Perkins (who was not the director asked to resign) voiced strong objections to the manner in which the leak investigation findings were presented to the Board and to the decision to ask the director to resign. For these reasons, Perkins resigned from the Board and left the meeting. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commissions Division of Enforcement, said, This action highlights the importance of the required disclosures regarding corporate governance issues. The Federal securities laws exist to ensure transparency, and investors have a right to know when a dispute among board members over operations, policies or practices causes a director to resign, as such a dispute may have far-reaching ramifications for the company. Marc Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the Commissions San Francisco Regional Office, added, The company viewed this as a personal dispute between a director and the Chairman and opted to stay silent about the disagreement. But the failure to make the required disclosures deprived investors of important information about the management of the company by its Board of Directors. The Commissions Order charges HP with violating the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, HP consented to an order that it cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.

387,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges in federal district court for the Northern District of California against California-based software maker Mercury Interactive, LLC (formerly known as Mercury Interactive Corporation) and four former senior officers of Mercury  former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Amnon Landan, former Chief Financial Officers Sharlene Abrams and Douglas Smith, and former General Counsel Susan Skaer. The SEC alleges that the former senior officers perpetrated a fraudulent and deceptive scheme from 1997 to 2005 to award themselves and other employees undisclosed, secret compensation by backdating stock option grants, failing to record hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation expense, and falsifying documents to further this scheme. The SEC also alleges that during this period Mercury, through Landan and at times Abrams, Smith or Skaer, made fraudulent disclosures concerning Mercury's ""backlog"" of sales revenues to manage its reported earnings, and structured fraudulent loans for option exercises by overseas employees to avoid recording expenses. Mercury, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Company on Nov. 8, 2006, after the alleged misconduct, settled the matter by agreeing to pay a $28 million civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined. The SEC's case against the four former officers is being litigated. ""The $28 million corporate penalty in this case, together with a permanent injunction, should send a clear signal that fraudulent stock option backdating and other financial fraud will be severely punished,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. ""The Commission's Enforcement Division will reinforce that principle by vigorously pursuing the charges against the individuals who were responsible. In this case as well as those that will follow, the SEC will do everything within our power to see to it that illegal options backdating is stamped out."" Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The array of fraudulent conduct at Mercury Interactive over an eight year period, including backdating dozens of stock option grants, backdating senior executive stock option exercises, structuring of overseas option exercises to conceal expenses and concealing the true nature of its earnings, deprived Mercury Interactive's shareholders and the market of accurate information regarding executive compensation and the company's accounting for stock options. The widespread and pernicious misconduct  including lying to shareholders, intentionally false accounting, and fraudulent stock options backdating  in this case warrants the significant sanctions imposed on the company and sought from the former executives."" Christopher Conte, Associate Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The individual defendants charged today are alleged to have realized millions of dollars in illicit compensation and stock sale profits through their secret backdating scheme and to have deceived Mercury Interactive investors through repeated misrepresentations about the company's stock option practices and compensation costs. The Commission's first ever use of Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley  which allows the Commission to seek the repayment of bonuses and stock sale profits received by CEOs and CFOs where financial results are later restated  reflects the Commission's willingness to use all available remedies to deprive such senior officers of illicit gains."" The SEC's complaint alleges that from 1997 to 2002, Mercury, acting through Landan and at various times Abrams, Smith and Skaer, backdated the date on which stock options were granted to executives and employees. The backdating made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of the company's stock  despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved  and resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options. The senior officers used hindsight to select the purported grant dates of the options, backdating the grants by anywhere from days to as much as over four months and making the grants in-the-money from 40 cents to $60 on the date they were actually approved. The complaint alleges that from 1997 through 2005, the accounting consequences of these benefits were then concealed as Landan, and at various times Abrams, Smith, Skaer and others, caused Mercury to fail to record over $258 million in compensation expenses and to provide false and misleading compensation disclosures to Mercury's shareholders in filings with the Commission. Mercury and the senior executives continued the backdating for years in spite of a specific change mandated and approved by shareholders in 1998 that required the exercise price of all employee options to be 100% of the fair market value of the company's stock on the grant date. The SEC alleges that the company backdated 45 different stock option grants to executives and employees, representing every grant made by the company to executives and employees during 1997 to April 2002. As alleged in the complaint, Skaer, or others at her direction, prepared false documentation memorializing the grants, including false written consents and meeting minutes. The complaint alleges that Landan, Abrams, Smith and Skaer each personally benefited by receiving backdated stock options that were in-the-money by, in the aggregate, millions of dollars through the fraudulent scheme. The complaint also alleges that from 1998 through 2001, Mercury, acting through Landan, Abrams and Skaer, fraudulently backdated the date of option exercises of certain senior Mercury officers. According to the complaint, senior executives were given preferential treatment and on multiple occasions were permitted to backdate the date of exercise of stock options with the company. The complaint alleges that these executives, including Landan and Abrams, backdated option exercises to dates consistent with low-points of the company's stock, in order to minimize their taxable gain on exercise or receive more favorable long-term capital gains treatment on profits they earned upon the later sale of the stock acquired through exercise. For example, the complaint alleges that in connection with three backdated exercises, Landan was able to underreport over $18 million in gains upon exercise. In fact, Landan and Abrams at times backdated the exercise of backdated option grants. The company concealed from its shareholders the benefits reaped by these executives by making fraudulent proxy disclosures relating to officer stock option exercises, while Landan, Abrams and Skaer also concealed the backdated exercises in Forms 4 filed with the Commission. In addition, the complaint alleges that during at least 1997 through 2001, Mercury, through Landan, Abrams and others, secretly managed the company's reported earnings per share (""EPS"") to meet or exceed financial analyst expectations by manipulating the recognition of revenue and making fraudulent disclosures concerning its sales orders. According to the complaint, Mercury stopped the shipment of its products once revenue targets for a period had been achieved, pushing the recognition of the revenue into subsequent periods. Between 1998 and 2001, this practice allowed the company to shift material amounts of revenue between reporting periods (from between $35 million to approximately $182 million in revenues). The company concealed the effect of this stop-shipment practice from the public through fraudulent and misleading statements and omissions concerning the ""backlog"" of its product bookings. Landan and Abrams understood that the backlog of revenues was material information that was being concealed from analysts and investors. For example, a 1999 PowerPoint presentation by Abrams to Landan and others concerning the company's financial picture stated in a slide: ""Our Hidden Backlog . . . What Any Analyst Would Love to Get Their Hands On!"" Finally, the complaint alleges that during 1999 through 2005, at various times Abrams, Skaer, and others participated in the fraudulent structuring of loans for stock option exercises by overseas employees of the company in order to conceal the variable accounting consequences of those transactions, causing the company to fail to report approximately $24 million in required compensation expenses, which materially overstated the company's reported pre-tax earnings during this period. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mercury agreed to pay a $28 million civil penalty to settle the Commission's charges. Mercury also agreed to an injunction that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9. The complaint alleges that Landan, Abrams, Smith and Skaer violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, equity transaction reporting and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges that Landan and Smith violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading concerning Mercury's 2002 through 2005 periodic reports. The SEC's complaint seeks against each of the individuals permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties and officer and director bars. In addition, the complaint seeks against Landan and Smith reimbursement of bonuses and profits from stock sales pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

388,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today a settled enforcement action against International Business Machines Corporation for making materially misleading statements in a chart concerning the impact that the company's decision to expense employee stock options would have on its first quarter 2005 (1Q05) and fiscal year 2005 (FY05) financial results. The misleading chart caused analysts to lower their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the company. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Information regarding a company's earnings is one of the most important factors that many investors consider in making an investment decision, and it is essential that the information companies provide be clear and accurate."" The Commission found that IBM provided the misleading information during an April 5, 2005 conference call with analysts. The call was simultaneously webcast, and a transcript and the accompanying exhibits were filed with the Commission in a Form 8-K. During the call, IBM announced that beginning in 1Q05 it would report stock options as an expense in its financial statements and advised analysts to adjust their earnings models to account for the change. At the time, IBM expected that its stock options expense for 1Q05 would have a $0.10 impact on first quarter EPS results and estimated a $0.39 impact on FY05 EPS results. However, IBM did not disclose this information. IBM included a misleading chart in its presentation which, to many analysts, conveyed that the EPS impact of IBM's stock options expense would be $0.14 for 1Q05 and $0.55 for FY05. After IBM's April 5 announcement, the majority of analysts reduced their EPS estimates by these amounts. SEC Associate Director of Enforcement Scott W. Friestad said, ""IBM misled investors by failing to disclose information that would have allowed them to accurately determine the impact that the company's decision to expense stock options would have on its financial results. The facts here are particularly troubling because the disclosure decision was driven, in part, by management's perception of how the news would be interpreted by analysts."" The Commission's Order finds that IBM did not disclose its expected stock options expense because it was concerned that analysts would add back to their EPS estimates any year-to-year reduction in the options expense instead of using the reduction to off-set an unrelated, previously-announced increased pension expense. According to the Order, management wanted to avoid this outcome because it would have increased the expected growth rate that analysts had set for IBM, which would have been difficult for the company to achieve because of the year-to-year increase in pension expense. On April 14, 2005, IBM announced its 1Q05 financial results and disclosed earnings of $0.85 per share, which was $0.05 less than the amount that many analysts were expecting following the April 5 presentation. IBM also disclosed that its equity compensation expense was $0.10 per share for 1Q05, or $0.04 lower than what many analysts had understood IBM's April 5 misleading chart to have indicated it would be. IBM's stock price dropped $6.94 the next day, or over 8%, closing at $76.33.

392,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Silicon Valley semiconductor company KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLA) and its former Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth L. Schroeder, alleging that they engaged in an illicit scheme to backdate stock option grants. The Commission alleges that, since 1997, KLA concealed more than $200 million in stock option compensation by providing employees and executives with potentially lucrative ""in-the-money"" options while secretly backdating the grants to avoid reporting the expenses to investors. The Commission further alleges that Schroeder, of Los Altos Hills, Calif., repeatedly backdated options between 1999 and 2002, and once in 2005 - even after he received advice from company counsel that retroactively selecting grant dates without adequate disclosure was improper. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, stated, ""KLA dramatically overstated its reported financial results, depriving investors of accurate information about the company's compensation costs and financial performance. It is especially troubling for a public company to engage in such misconduct even after being cautioned that these practices were impermissible."" The Commission's complaint against KLA, filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., alleges that former company executives routinely used hindsight to issue options to employees priced at or near KLA's lowest stock price of the preceding weeks. Although pricing the options below current prices required the company to report a compensation charge under well-settled accounting principles, former KLA officials avoided reporting the charges by falsely documenting that the options had been granted on an earlier date. The backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with the Company overstating its net income in fiscal years 1998 through 2005 by as much as 156 percent. In a separate complaint filed against Schroeder, the Commission charges that he repeatedly engaged in backdating after becoming CEO in 1999, including pricing large awards of options to himself that were ""in the money"" by millions of dollars - a potential windfall never disclosed to KLA-Tencor's shareholders. According to the complaint, Schroeder received a legal memorandum in March 2001 cautioning that ""the Board and its committees are limited in their ability to grant options at a retroactive price without exposing the company to risk of an accounting charge."" The memo further warned that ""[a]ny attempt to set a price before such a grant is made raises substantial risks under securities and tax laws [and] accounting rules and gives rise to disclosure obligations."" The Commission alleges that Schroeder nonetheless continued to backdate options. KLA-Tencor, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of federal securities laws. The Commission declined to charge the company with fraud or seek a monetary penalty, based in part on the company's swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation, as well as its far-reaching remedial measures. KLA-Tencor's cooperation included an independent internal investigation and the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government. The company also took significant remedial actions in response to the findings of its internal investigation, including the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct, removal of certain senior executives and board members, and the re-pricing and cancellation of retroactively-priced options held by several individuals. Marc J. Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, stated, ""KLA-Tencor went to great lengths to clean house after discovering the fraud, and their cooperation greatly facilitated the government's investigation."" The complaint against Schroeder alleges that he violated, or aided and abetted, violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, lying to auditors, equity transaction reporting and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges Schroeder signed false certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and monetary penalties against Schroeder, in addition to an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In addition, the complaint seeks reimbursement of bonuses and profits from stock sales pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Commission's investigation is continuing.",-0.6,Negative
393,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil fraud action against Robert J. Therrien, former President and CEO of Brooks Automation, Inc., a Massachusetts software company, alleging that he received millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation by fraudulently backdating his exercise of an option to purchase company stock. Therrien also is alleged to have engaged in a broader fraudulent scheme to grant himself and other Brooks employees and executives undisclosed, in-the-money stock options. The complaint alleges that Therrien personally benefited by more than $10 million from his fraudulent conduct. ""All companies must play by the same rules when it comes to accounting for employee compensation and reporting its impact on the company's bottom line,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. ""Executives who violate these rules for their own personal benefit will be held accountable for their actions."" David Bergers, Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, added, ""Investors have the right to complete and accurate information about the financial condition of public companies and the compensation their executives receive. The Commission will continue to aggressively pursue actions against individuals who engage in fraudulent options practices that mislead investors."" The Commission's civil complaint alleges that Therrien received approximately $5.8 million in undisclosed compensation in November 1999, when he fraudulently backdated his exercise of an option to purchase 225,000 shares of Brooks stock. According to the complaint, after learning that his option had expired unexercised in August 1999, Therrien signed false documents indicating that he had actually exercised his option before its expiration. As a result, the company issued Therrien a new in-the-money option at the original price, which he immediately exercised to purchase company stock at a fraction of the market price when the option was re-issued. The Commission's civil complaint further alleges that, on at least four occasions from 1999 through 2001, Therrien approved the issuance to company executives and employees of stock options that were backdated to earlier dates on which the stock's market price was lower. Through backdating, options that were in-the-money (with exercise prices below the market price) on the date they were actually granted were disguised as at-the-money options (with exercise prices at the market prices) purportedly granted on an earlier date. As a result of these instances of option backdating, the complaint alleges, Therrien received another $4.6 million in undisclosed benefits. The complaint alleges that as a result of Therrien's misconduct, he benefited by a total of at least $10.4 million and Brooks overstated income and understated employee compensation expenses by at least $54 million in its financial statements during the period from 1999 through 2005. The complaint alleges that by his conduct Therrien violated the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and provisions that prohibit misrepresentations to auditors and falsification of records, and that he aided and abetted Brooks in its violations of financial reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls requirements. The Commission's action seeks injunctive relief, a civil penalty, disgorgement and an officer and director bar against Therrien. In a separate matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced a criminal indictment charging Therrien with tax evasion for his conduct in connection with the November 1999 option transaction.",-0.5882352941176471,Negative
394,"Continuing its crackdown on financial fraud against senior citizens, the Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an emergency action to shut down a $25 million Ponzi scheme that victimized hundreds of senior and other investors nationwide who bought fractional ownership interests in life insurance policies. The SEC asked a federal district court in Sacramento, Calif., to grant the SEC's request for an order temporarily prohibiting further sales of the products, freezing the assets, and appointing a receiver to take control of operations in order to manage and preserve remaining investor funds. The SEC has brought more than 40 enforcement actions over the past two years against frauds targeting retirees and other older investors, which will be a focus of the Commission's second annual Seniors Summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 10. The Summit also will include the release of findings from regulatory examinations of 110 firms offering ""free lunch"" investment seminars aimed at seniors. In the latest action, the Commission alleges that Donald Neuhaus of Redding, Calif., his daughter Kimberley Snowden, and their company Secure Investment Services, Inc., orchestrated the Ponzi scheme that falsely promised safe, secure and profitable interests in life insurance policies known as ""viaticals"" while failing to disclose the dire financial condition of the investment venture. Many of the investors were elderly and invested their retirement savings. The Commission also alleges the father-daughter fraudsters pocketed $700,000 for their personal use while the scam was on the verge of collapse. ""Moving to shut down this Ponzi scheme reaffirms the Commission's overall commitment to aggressively investigating and stopping those who prey upon the retirement funds of older Americans,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""These perpetrators lined their own pockets and deliberately disguised the serious risks that investors faced, misleading senior citizens and others to believe they were making safe and secure investments when, in reality, they were being lured into a financial crisis."" Helane L. Morrison, Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""The defendants engaged in a predatory scheme, making promises that they knew they could not keep to senior citizens and other investors. The requested court order temporarily halting this fraud is a critical step in protecting these investors and preserving their remaining assets."" According to the Commission's complaint, Neuhaus and Snowden sold shares of life insurance policies, calling them ""bonded life settlements."" They persuaded investors to buy the securities by representing that their money would be used to purchase and pay the necessary premiums on the life insurance policies. They promised returns up to 125 percent when the person insured by the policy died. The Commission's complaint alleges that Neuhaus and Snowden instead used investors' money for their own personal use and to cover the premiums on other insurance policies owned by other groups of investors. Their conduct constituted a Ponzi scheme in which every new investor was being defrauded to provide the cash needed to conceal the misrepresentations to an earlier group of investors. They failed to inform investors that the enterprise was on the brink of collapse, and that investors risked losing everything if life insurance policies expired due to lack of payment. The Commission further alleges that Neuhaus and Snowden misled investors by providing them with life expectancy estimates supposedly certified by a physician who was, in reality, a convicted felon falsely holding himself out as a physician. They falsely claimed that the investments were protected by bonding companies. But these were, in fact, unlicensed overseas firms with no assurance of actually repaying investors. The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, the California Department of Corporations and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service. * * * The SEC's Seniors Summit will begin at 10 a.m. ET on Sept. 10 and will be webcast live on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov.

395,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against a Bay Area attorney for her role in illegally backdating stock option grants. The Commission charged Lisa C. Berry with routinely backdating option grants from 1997 to 2003, first as General Counsel of KLA-Tencor Corporation and then as General Counsel of Juniper Networks, Inc. The Commission alleges that Berry's misconduct caused the two companies to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in stock option compensation expenses relating to undisclosed in-the-money options provided to company executives and employees. The Commission also announced today that it has filed a settled enforcement action against Juniper, an information technology company based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Juniper has consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. KLA, a San Jose-based semiconductor equipment company, previously settled charges brought by the Commission. ""The Commission's action today confirms that attorneys are no less bound by the securities laws than other public company executives,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""At both KLA and Juniper, Ms. Berry was in a unique position to insure that the companies accurately disclosed their stock option expenses; instead, she facilitated their fraud on investors."" Marc Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""By its use of hindsight to pick favorable grant dates, Juniper avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of expenses to its shareholders. Juniper's internal controls failed to detect the problem, resulting in its repeated reporting of false financial information to the public."" The Commission's complaint against Berry, filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., alleges that she routinely used hindsight to identify dates with historically low stock prices, facilitating the backdating of option grants by KLA's stock option committee. According to the Commission, Berry then moved to Juniper shortly before its 1999 IPO, touting her experience in stock administration. The complaint alleges that Berry established a similar backdating process at Juniper, creating minutes of fictitious stock option committee meetings to document false grant dates - at times affixing the names of other committee members with a signature stamp. According to the Commission's complaint, the backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with KLA overstating its net income in fiscal years 1998 through 1999 by as much as 47 percent and Juniper overstating its 2003 net income by nearly 22 percent. In 2007, both KLA and Juniper restated their financial statements, with Juniper recording nearly $900 million in previously unreported compensation expenses. In its action against Berry, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, reporting, and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement and interest, a civil penalty, and an order barring her from acting as an officer or director of a public company. The Commission's settlement with Juniper, also filed in federal district court in San Jose, provides that Juniper will be enjoined from violating the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, reporting, and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws. In considering Juniper's settlement offer, the Commission took into account the cooperation that Juniper provided Commission staff during its investigation.",-0.5,Negative

""As today's action shows, the Commission continues to be vigilant in seeking to ensure that self-regulatory organizations fulfill their obligations as regulators,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Self-regulatory organizations must expend the resources necessary to vigorously enforce their own rules and to detect and prevent misconduct by their member firms."" David P. Bergers, Regional Director of the Commission's Boston Regional Office, added, ""This settlement will strengthen the Boston Stock Exchange's regulatory functions and enhance investor protection. The audit called for by the settlement will assist the Exchange in making improvements to its surveillance program and help prevent misconduct from going undetected."" According to the Commission's Order, from 1999 to 2004, the Exchange and Crofwell failed to enforce Exchange rules that prohibited Exchange dealer specialist firms from trading securities for their own benefit at the expense of their customers. The Order finds that the Exchange failed to conduct adequate surveillance to detect and prevent violations of the customer priority rules. The Order also finds that Crofwell knew that the procedures then in effect were inadequate, but failed to devote resources necessary to correct the problem. Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission's Order, the Exchange and Crofwell each consented to a censure and an order to cease and desist from future violations of Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act, which requires exchanges to enforce rules governing member firms. The Exchange further agreed to comply with specific undertakings contained in the Order, including expenditure of at least $1 million to retain a third-party consultant to conduct comprehensive audits of the Exchange's surveillance, examination, investigation and disciplinary programs relating to trading, and implementation of the consultant's recommendations. Crofwell also consented, subject to court approval, to entry of a final judgment in a related settled civil action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty for aiding and abetting the Exchange's violations of section 19(g) of the Exchange Act.

397,"The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Hawaii Securities Commissioner today jointly announced the filing of separate securities fraud actions against a Honolulu man who ripped off older investors and retirees after offering them free meals at fancy restaurants and hotels in Hawaii. The SEC's emergency action in federal district court in Honolulu against Mark K. Teruya, age 35, and his company, Senior Resources of Hawaii, Inc., based in Honolulu, is the first connected to the year-long examination by the SEC and other regulators of financial services firms offering ""free lunch"" investment seminars that target older investors. Full results of the examination sweep will be released at the SEC's ""Senior Summit"" on Monday, September 10. The SEC action seeks to halt the defendants' fraudulent activities and strip them of their ill-gotten gains. Simultaneous with the filing of the SEC's complaint, the Hawaii Securities Commissioner issued a Preliminary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing against Teruya and Senior Resources seeking to revoke Teruya's state registration as an investment adviser representative. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said, ""This case stands as yet another important example of our continuing effort to aggressively combat frauds targeting seniors by partnering with state regulators to identify and bring these cases swiftly. As will be further examined during the SEC's second annual Seniors Summit on Monday, securities industry professionals who exploit the trust and confidence placed in them by seniors, as was the case here, can expect aggressive enforcement action by regulators."" Rosalind R. Tyson, Acting Director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, added, ""We have worked closely with the State of Hawaii to bring this action, and will continue to coordinate our efforts to prevent investors from being defrauded throughout this region. Today's action alleges conduct that enticed seniors to entrust their life savings to someone who claimed to be a 'certified retirement financial adviser' and promoted his services through free seminars offering a free meal and free individualized financial planning meetings. Under this guise, the defendants sought only to enrich themselves through undisclosed conflicts of interest and commissions."" ""Swindling seniors destroys families and communities,"" said Hawaii Commissioner of Securities Tung Chan. ""We have no tolerance for perpetrators of investment fraud, especially against seniors, and we will continue to work with the SEC to use all available state and federal tools to bring perpetrators to justice."" SEC enforcement staff joined forces with the State of Hawaii in taking action on this matter, sharing information and resources. SEC examination staff, acting on information provided by Hawaii securities regulators, inspected Teruya's office as part of a cooperative state, SRO, SEC examination sweep of financial services firms that sponsor ""free lunch"" investment seminars. These cases result from a multi-pronged effort to combat fraud against seniors through regulatory cooperation and coordination. Already, the SEC has brought more than 40 enforcement actions in the past two years against frauds targeting retirees and other older investors. Teruya is a representative of an SEC-registered investment adviser, which was not named in either of today's actions. According to the SEC's complaint, since at least 2004 and continuing as recently as August 2007, Teruya, through Senior Resources, has on multiple occasions fraudulently induced clients to sign a series of pre-printed, fill-in-the-blank forms by misrepresenting the purpose of the forms, the reasons that they needed prospective clients' signatures on the forms, and the way in which they would use the forms. The complaint alleges that Teruya used the signed forms to sell the seniors' existing securities holdings without their knowledge or authorization. The complaint also alleges that Teruya, who is also a licensed insurance agent, then used the proceeds of the unauthorized sales to purchase equity-indexed annuities for which he received substantial, undisclosed commissions totaling about $2 million. The complaint alleges that each month the defendants lured about 75 senior citizens, mostly retirees in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, to free breakfast and dinner seminars focusing on retirement financial planning. The complaint alleges that the defendants targeted seniors through advertisements in local newspapers, such as The Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and direct mail invitations. The advertisements featured eye-catching headlines, such as ""7 Seldom Heard, Significant Financial Opportunities [That] May Be Available to Many Retirees,"" and ""10 Common Costly Financial Mistakes Hawaii Retirees May Make and Ways to Avoid Them."" As alleged in the complaint, defendants then offered seminar attendees free one-on-one consultations with Teruya, a self-proclaimed ""certified retirement financial adviser."" The complaint further alleges that, during these individual meetings, defendants fraudulently induced the seniors to sign the blank forms. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Hawaii's Preliminary Order to Cease and Desist names Teruya, Senior Resources of Hawaii, Incorporated doing business as USA Wealth Resources, Ronda Teruya, Rodelia Ferrer, and Craig Teruya with securities fraud and unworthiness in violation of the state securities laws, Sections 485-25 and 485-15 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

The 69 firms and partners named in todayâs actions were collectively responsible for issuing 60 audit reports for 53 companies between November 2003 and October 2005. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Enforcement Division, said, âThe Commission is committed to ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework Congress established for auditors of public companies. When these auditors failed to register with the PCAOB, they violated one of the key requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and evaded the PCAOBâs oversight authority. The actions we take today protect investors and will deter future violations of Sarbanes-Oxleyâs registration provision.â Twenty-eight firms and 22 partners agreed to settlements in which the Commission found that each audit firm issued between one and eight audit reports while unregistered, and ordered the firms and partners to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the registration provision of Sarbanes-Oxley, Section 102(a). The Commission also censured the firms. Additionally, two firms agreed to disgorge audit fees they received for their audits, while the other settling firms that received audit fees returned the fees to their issuers during the course of the Commissionâs investigation. Without admitting or denying the findings of the Orders, each of the settling firms and partners consented to the entry of an order finding that they violated Section 102(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The firms and partners who settled the proceedings are named in the following 29 settled Orders. Separately, the Commission issued ten Orders instituting proceedings against a total of nine nonsettling firms and ten nonsettling partners. The Orders allege that the firms and partners prepared and issued audit reports that issuers included in filings with the Commission. The Orders allege that the firms were not registered with the PCAOB. As to all of the nonsettling audit firms, the Orders instituting proceedings will determine whether, pursuant to Section 4C(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, the firms failed to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others and willfully violated Section 102(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley. As to all of the nonsettling partners, the Orders will determine whether the partners failed to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others by participating in the preparation and issuance of audit reports by a firm that was not registered with the PCAOB. All of the proceedings against the nonsettling firms and partners will determine what remedial relief, if any, is appropriate, including whether they should be censured or denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants. The nonsettling firms and partners named in the ten Orders are In addition, as to three of the above nonsettling firms and three of the above nonsettling partners â Halt, Buzas & Powell, Ltd.; Jay J. Shapiro, CPA, P.C.; Jay J. Shapiro, CPA; Michael Deutchman, CPA; Lester Rex Andersen, CPA; and Richard E. Sellers, CPA â the Orders also institute cease-and-desist proceedings to determine whether a cease-and-desist order should issue against each of them and whether each of them, with the exception of Michael Deutchman, CPA, should be ordered to pay disgorgement of audit fees.

399,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 38 defendants in a series of fraudulent schemes involving phony finder fees and illegal kickbacks in the ""stock loan"" industry. The defendants include 17 current and former ""stock loan"" traders employed at several major Wall Street brokerage firms, including Morgan Stanley, Van der Moolen (VDM), Janney Montgomery, A.G. Edwards, Oppenheimer, and Nomura Securities. These traders conspired in various schemes with 21 purported stock loan ""finders"" to skim profits on stock loan transactions. The defendants pocketed more than $12 million from their unlawful schemes over a period of nearly a decade. In two separate complaints filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., the SEC alleges that from 1998 until June 2006, the stock loan traders named as defendants routinely defrauded the brokerage firms that employed them and others by engaging in collusive loan transactions and causing the firms to pay sham finder fees to companies controlled by the traders themselves or by their friends and relatives. Acting as fronts for the traders, these companies received hefty finder fees on several thousand stock loan transactions even though they did not provide any legitimate finding services and, in many cases, were simply shell companies that were not even involved in the stock loan business. These phony finders included a mailman, a perfume salesman, a pharmacist and a dental receptionist. The defendants shared in the sham finder fees through secret kickback arrangements. In some cases, defendants met monthly at New York City bars and restaurants to exchange thousands of dollars in cash, often wrapped in newspapers or stuffed into envelopes. Linda C. Thomsen, Director of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The defendants in these cases devised a host of brazen schemes to enrich themselves and others at the expense of firms engaged in securities lending transactions. The Commission will respond forcefully to misconduct in the securities industry, whether it occurs on Wall Street or Main Street and whether it is committed by individuals or large firms."" David Rosenfeld, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office, added, ""As the breadth of today's action demonstrates, fraud was rampant in certain segments of the securities lending industry. Securities professionals who engage in collusion, cash kickback payments and outright theft undermine the integrity of our markets and will be confronted with aggressive enforcement action."" In one of the complaints filed today, SEC v. Darin DeMizio, et al., the Commission alleges that over the course of several years, two stock loan traders employed by Morgan Stanley â Darin DeMizio and Peter Sherlock â and three other individuals, including relatives of the two traders, skimmed millions of dollars in stock lending profits from Morgan Stanley and another brokerage firm through illegal kickback schemes with a stock loan finder named Anthony Lupo. From July 2000 through June 2006, Lupo collected more than $4 million in finder fees as a result of these schemes and paid more than $1 million in undisclosed kickbacks. Pursuant to the scheme, Darin DeMizio and Sherlock caused Morgan Stanley to enter into unnecessary loan transactions at inferior interest rates for the purpose of artificially generating finder fees for Lupo. In exchange, Lupo paid kickbacks directly to Sherlock in cash and paid nearly $600,000 to shell companies controlled by Darin DeMizio's brother, Craig DeMizio, and Sherlock's brother-in-law, Donato Tramontozzi, a full-time pharmacist. In a second and related scheme, Joseph Miller, a finder and former stock loan trader at Morgan Stanley, paid undisclosed cash kickbacks to a stock loan trader at a division of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) in exchange for receiving PNC stock loan orders from the trader. Lupo also participated and shared in the profits from the scheme. From January 2002 to June 2004, Lupo and Miller split more than $1.2 million in finder fees generated by PNC orders. Miller ended his arrangement with Lupo in May 2003, but Miller continued the kickback scheme with the PNC trader on his own until January 2005. In the second complaint filed today, SEC v. Joseph Simone, et al., the Commission alleges that 21 individuals, including 15 securities industry professionals, and seven entities involved in the stock loan business, engaged in widespread fraudulent conduct by using various schemes to skim stock lending profits from several brokerage firms. In these schemes, stock loan traders routinely defrauded their firms by causing the firms to pay finder fees to entities that did not perform any services at all on the relevant loans and, in most cases, were simply shell companies controlled by traders or their relatives. Where the traders were unaffiliated with the finders, the finders paid undisclosed cash kickbacks to the traders. From 1999 to 2005, the finders named as defendants received more than $8 million in sham finder fees. The named traders either arranged or facilitated the payment of these sham fees. Some of the traders also paid undisclosed cash kickbacks out of their illegal profits to other traders that facilitated those loan transactions. This complaint specifically alleges as follows. The Commission's complaints seek permanent antifraud injunctions, disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York has filed parallel criminal charges against 16 of the individuals named in the Commission's complaints. Ten of those individuals have entered guilty pleas: Simone, Caracciolo, Sorrentino, Carannante, Daronzio, Roman, Sarnicola, McCormack, Gary Manfre and Miller. In connection with his guilty plea, Simone also agreed to pay a total of $3.6 million in forfeiture. Simone, Island, Gary Manfre, Richard Manfre and RAM have agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of permanent antifraud injunctions. Gary Manfre, Richard Manfre and RAM also will jointly disgorge $94,262, the total amount of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. Because Simone has agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the SEC case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains. The Commission's claims for civil penalties against Simone, Island and Gary Manfre, and all of its claims against the other defendants in both cases, remain pending. In addition, the Commission today issued administrative orders respectively barring Simone, Gary Manfre and Caracciolo from association with any broker-dealer. The three respondents consented to the issuance of the respective orders. The Commission's investigation is ongoing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

401,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against New York hedge fund adviser Sandell Asset Management Corp. (SAM), its chief executive officer, and two other employees for engaging in improper short sales in connection with trading in the securities of Hibernia Corporation in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Hibernia was a New Orleans-based bank holding company and the subject of an acquisition agreement with Capital One Financial Corporation at the time Katrina occurred. As part of its merger arbitrage investment strategy, SAM held a large long position in Hibernia. According to the Commission's Order, SAM personnel believed that Capital One would lower its offering price for Hibernia shares in the wake of Katrina. In an attempt to offset an anticipated loss to a client, SAM personnel began to sell short as many shares of Hibernia stock as possible, improperly marking certain sales orders as ""long"" or misrepresenting to the broker-dealers executing some of the trades that they had located stock to borrow. ""Today's action is part of our ongoing effort to ensure that hedge funds comply with the federal securities laws, including all applicable trading rules,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""By mismarking certain trades and falsely claiming that firm personnel had located stock to borrow, Sandell Asset Management gained an unfair trading advantage over other market participants. This settlement deprives the firm of the profits made from the improper trading, and includes penalties and other sanctions designed to deter others from engaging in similar misconduct."" Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, SAM agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle the charges, including $6,716,683.93 in disgorgement, $730,811.74 in prejudgment interest, and a $650,000 civil penalty. Also charged were the firm's CEO Thomas Sandell, senior managing director Patrick Burke, and head trader Richard Ecklord, all of whom consented to the Commission's Order without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Sandell, Burke and Ecklord were ordered to pay civil penalties of $100,000, $50,000 and $40,000, respectively. The Commission's Order finds that, after the Hibernia-Capital One merger was announced on March 6, 2005, SAM purchased approximately 9.3 million shares of Hibernia stock for one of the firm's hedge fund clients. Thereafter, SAM sold the Hibernia shares to third parties and entered into ""swap"" transactions with them. The hedge fund managed by SAM no longer owned the Hibernia shares, but retained all of the economic risk of loss if the price of the shares declined. On Aug. 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, where Hibernia was headquartered and maintained substantial assets. On Aug. 31, 2005, in its effort to offset a potential loss to its client, SAM personnel improperly marked certain sales orders as ""long"" even though they were, in fact, short. On Sept. 2, 2005, SAM personnel made some additional short sales by representing to the broker-dealers executing the trades that they had located stock to borrow, when in fact they had not. The Commission's Order finds that the Aug. 31 trades violated Section 10(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10a-1 and that the Sept. 2 trades violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission's Order censures each of the respondents and orders SAM to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

402,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against David H. Brooks, the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board at DHB Industries, Inc., a major supplier of body armor to the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Brooks engaged in a pervasive accounting fraud at DHB between 2003 and 2005, violated insider trading laws in 2004, and used millions of dollars in corporate funds to pay personal expenses. ""This case shows that the SEC will not tolerate the improper use of corporate funds to pay personal expenses,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. David Nelson, the SEC Regional Director in Miami, added, ""This case involves egregious conduct by a company CEO. As always, we aggressively pursue and prosecute company executives who betray the trust of public shareholders in order to line their own pockets."" The SEC's complaint alleges that Brooks, with the assistance of DHB's former chief financial officer and chief operating officer, manipulated the company's gross profit margin and net income by overstating inventory values, falsifying journal entries, and failing to include appropriate charges for obsolete inventory. According to the SEC's complaint, Brooks also funneled millions of dollars out of DHB through fraudulent transactions with a related entity he controlled. The complaint further alleges that Brooks used company credit cards and checks to pay millions of dollars in personal expenses, including luxury cars, jewelry, art, real estate, extravagant vacations, personal aircraft usage, and horse training. As a result of the misconduct by Brooks, DHB filed false and misleading financial documents with the SEC and made false statements in company press releases. The complaint also alleges that Brooks sold his personal DHB stock for proceeds of about $186 million at the end of 2004 at the height of DHB's stock price, and did so while in possession of material, non-public information - a violation of insider trading laws. The complaint charges Brooks with violating the antifraud, insider trading, reporting, books and records, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, monetary penalties, and an officer and director bar. In addition, the complaint seeks reimbursement by Brooks to DHB of bonuses and profits from stock sales pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. At the time of the alleged conduct, Brooks was subject to an SEC injunction entered by a federal court in December 1992 against future violations of the antifraud provisions. In addition, in December 1992, the Commission, in an administrative proceeding, barred Brooks from association with any broker or dealer for a period of five years. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York conducted a parallel investigation of this matter. Simultaneous with the SEC's announcement, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced the filing of charges against Brooks for securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, insider trading, and obstructing the SEC's investigation, among other charges. The SEC's investigation is continuing.",-0.5,Negative
403,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil charges against Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., a Silicon Valley semiconductor company, and the company's former CEO and CFO, alleging that they reported false financial information to investors by improperly backdating stock option grants to Maxim employees and directors. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, stated, ""Maxim's seeming ability to pick favorable grant dates for its employees was too good to be true â in ten consecutive quarters, Maxim granted options on the date with the lowest stock price of the quarter. In reality, Maxim selected these supposed grant dates with the benefit of hindsight, allowing it to hide millions of dollars in expenses from shareholders."" Marc J. Fagel, Co-Acting Regional Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""Of particular concern here was the CFO's abandoning his role as corporate gatekeeper and instead facilitating Maxim's misrepresentations about its stock option program and financial condition."" The Commission alleges that former CFO Carl W. Jasper, of San Jose, Calif., helped the company fraudulently conceal tens of millions of dollars in compensation expenses through the use of backdated, ""in-the-money"" option grants. In a separate action, former President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board John F. Gifford, of Menlo Park, Calif., agreed to pay more than $800,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties to settle charges relating to his role in the options backdating. Maxim similarly has agreed to settle the Commission's charges against it. The Commission's complaints, filed in federal district court in San Jose, allege that Maxim routinely provided potentially lucrative in-the-money options (i.e., options granted at below market prices) to employees. Under well-settled accounting principles, granting in-the-money options obligated the company to report compensation expenses to shareholders. The Commission alleges that Maxim avoided reporting these expenses by backdating paperwork to make it appear that the options had been granted on an earlier date. As a result, the company overstated its net income by more than 10% for its fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The Commission's complaints also allege that former CFO Jasper was aware of the improper backdating practices, drafted backdated grant approval documents for Maxim's CEO to sign, and disregarded instructions from CEO Gifford to record an expense in connection with certain backdated options. According to the Commission, Gifford should have known that the company was not reporting expenses for those in-the-money stock options and instead was falsely reporting that they were granted at fair market value. Maxim, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Gifford, also without admitting or denying the allegations, agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and also agreed to disgorge a portion of his bonuses (totaling $652,681 with prejudgment interest) and pay a $150,000 civil penalty. The Commission's litigated action against Jasper charges him with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of wrongful profits, a civil penalty, and an order barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

404,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the longtime, primary outside attorney for Refco Group Ltd. with aiding and abetting securities fraud violations at the now-defunct New York-based financial services and commodities brokerage firm. The SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Joseph P. Collins, a partner at the law firm of Mayer Brown LLP, alleging that he substantially assisted Refco and its corporate successor, Refco Inc., as they failed to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in related party indebtedness and related party transactions. âFinancial and disclosure frauds are often possible only if an attorney, an accountant, or some other outside professional assists,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe Commission relies on these professionals to act as gatekeepers to our markets. We will aggressively pursue individuals who ignore their professional obligations and instead assist in their clientsâ violation of the federal securities laws.â Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement, said, âAs a result of his longstanding relationship with his client, Collins was aware that Refco was hiding important facts from potential investors. Collins was in a perfect position to protect investors from being harmed, but chose instead to perpetuate the deception by actively assisting Refcoâs fraud.â The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Collins, in the course of representing Refco, learned that Refco Group Holdings, Inc. (RGHI) owed Refco hundreds of millions of dollars. RGHI was a non-Refco entity controlled by Phillip R. Bennett, Refcoâs chief executive officer. The complaint further alleges that Collins worked on, and oversaw other attorneysâ work on, short-term related party transactions that occurred regularly at the end of Refco fiscal periods from February 2000 through May 2005. In these transactions, a Refco subsidiary loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to third parties that, in turn, were obligated to loan equal amounts simultaneously to RGHI. Shortly after the ends of fiscal periods, the loans were reversed. Refco assumed hundreds of millions of dollars in potential liabilities in these transactions, in the form of guaranties and indemnification that it extended to the third parties to protect them from a default by RGHI or claims that might arise out of the loans. In 2004, Refco placed $600 million in senior subordinated notes with certain financial institutions pursuant to an offering circular. In 2005, Refco commenced its initial public offering of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Commission. The SECâs complaint alleges that the offering circular failed to disclose RGHIâs indebtedness, the period end transactions, and the related potential liabilities. It also is alleged that the registration statement failed to disclose the indebtedness and the potential liabilities. The complaint further alleges that Collins, while aware of the indebtedness and the transactions, reviewed and revised sections of the offering circular and the registration statement without inserting requisite disclosures regarding the indebtedness, the period-end transactions, and the potential liabilities. The SECâs complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Collins from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also seeks civil money penalties against Collins. In a related action, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York today announced the filing of criminal charges against Collins for his role in the Refco fraud.

The SECâs complaint alleges that the offering circular failed to disclose RGHIâs indebtedness, the period end transactions, and the related potential liabilities. It also is alleged that the registration statement failed to disclose the indebtedness and the potential liabilities. The complaint further alleges that Collins, while aware of the indebtedness and the transactions, reviewed and revised sections of the offering circular and the registration statement without inserting requisite disclosures regarding the indebtedness, the period-end transactions, and the potential liabilities. The SECâs complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Collins from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also seeks civil money penalties against Collins. In a related action, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York today announced the filing of criminal charges against Collins for his role in the Refco fraud.

406,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former San Francisco-area employees of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) with insider trading. According to the Commissionâs complaint, Gregory B. Raben, 30, a former PwC auditor, and William Patrick Borchard, 28, a former senior associate in PwCâs Transaction Services Group, used their access to sensitive information about PwCâs clients to allow Raben to buy stock ahead of a series of corporate takeovers. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Raben and Borchard agreed to a settlement including monetary penalties. âTodayâs charges of insider trading by accounting firm employees are another example of the Commissionâs commitment to exposing insider trading by industry professionals who have access to confidential market information unavailable to the investing public,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âRaben and Borchard violated PwCâs rules on keeping client information strictly confidential and ignored their duties to their employer and its clients,â added Marc Fagel, Co-Acting Regional Director of the SECâs San Francisco Regional Office. The Commissionâs complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Borchard learned about the potential acquisition plans of PwC clients through his position in the Transaction Services Group, where he handled financial due diligence for clients interested in mergers or acquisitions. On six separate occasions in 2006, Borchard told his friend and co-worker Raben about these confidential plans. Raben then used the information to trade before the news was released to the investing public. The pairâs scheme continued until October 2006, when it was uncovered by PwCâs Office of General Counsel, which referred the matter to the Commission and cooperated with the SEC staffâs investigation. According to the Commissionâs complaint, Raben netted unlawful trading profits of more than $20,000 by buying stock ahead of public announcements disclosing the acquisitions and then selling his shares. Raben also tipped two other acquaintances about two of the acquisitions, allowing them to make several thousand dollars in unlawful trading profits. Raben (now of Louisville, Ky.) has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. He will disgorge his trading profits and those of the two acquaintances he tipped, altogether totaling $23,879.22, and will pay a civil penalty of $23,879.22. Borchard (now of Chicago), a licensed Certified Public Accountant, has consented to a permanent injunction and a civil penalty of $20,835.57 (equal to Rabenâs trading profits), as well as an order denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to apply to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission after three years.

407,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $24 million settlement with a former Dow Jones & Company board member and three other Hong Kong residents accused of illegal tipping and insider trading ahead of news of an unsolicited buyout offer from News Corporation that sent Dow Jones shares soaring last spring. The SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleges that David Li Kwok Po, a Dow Jones board member at the time who also is Chairman and CEO of the Bank of East Asia and a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Counsel and Executive Committee, learned of the then-secret News Corp. offer and illegally tipped his close friend Michael Leung Kai Hung. The SEC complaint also alleges that Leung, with the help of his daughter Charlotte Ka On Wong Leung and son-in-law Kan King Wong purchased approximately $15 million worth of Dow Jones securities in their account at Merrill Lynch. They stood to make approximately $8 million in illicit profits had the SEC not won an emergency court order within days of the News Corp. offer, freezing the account and stopping the money from moving half a world away. ""Protecting the integrity of our markets in today's world of global trading and instant communications requires real-time enforcement across national borders,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. ""This case makes clear that the SEC will move fast, and decisively, not only in the United States but around the world to protect investors from insider dealings and threats to fair and open markets. It also illustrates the value of the significant international partnerships we are developing with our regulatory partners in other nations."" ""Insider trading on merger and acquisition information continues to be a top enforcement priority,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We hope this case sends a forceful reminder to corporate insiders that they need to exercise careful discretion when discussing important business matters outside the boardroom and executive suite."" Cheryl J. Scarboro, Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, added, ""Tipping and trading by corporate insiders corrupts our markets, and today's action demonstrates our ability to stop this type of misconduct in its tracks - no matter where it occurs and who is involved."" Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, David Li, Michael Leung, K.K. Wong and Charlotte Wong consented to the entry of court orders enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. David Li is ordered to pay an $8.1 million civil penalty. Michael Leung is ordered to pay $8.1 million in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and an $8.1 million penalty. K.K. Wong is ordered to pay $40,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a $40,000 civil penalty. The SEC previously filed an emergency action against the Wongs on May 8, 2007, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for alleged trading on inside information. The court entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets and imposing other relief (see LR-20106). In its amended complaint filed today, the Commission also alleges that K.K. Wong bought 2,000 Dow Jones shares in his TD-Ameritrade account and made approximately $40,000 in profits.

408,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against a hedge fund, its investment adviser, its founder and CEO, and two employees for their roles in an illegal late trading scheme. The SEC charged hedge fund Ritchie Multi-Strategy Global Trading Ltd. and its Chicago-based adviser â Ritchie Capital Management LLC â as well as Ritchie Capitalâs founder and CEO A.R. Thane Ritchie and employees Warren DeMaio and Michael Mauriello. They will pay a combined total of approximately $40 million to settle the SECâs charges. These payments will be distributed to the affected mutual funds. âThis action demonstrates the Commissionâs willingness to take strong action against hedge fund advisers and their employees when they violate the federal securities laws. Here, respondents did so by engaging in illegal late trading in mutual funds,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the SECâs Chicago Regional Office, said, âRitchie Capital concealed its late trading by receiving pre-4 p.m. time-stamps on its order tickets. The respondentsâ attempt to cover their tracks by using falsified order tickets merely underscores the egregiousness of the fraudulent scheme and commends the thorough and tenacious investigative work that uncovered it.â The Commissionâs Order finds that from January 2001 through September 2003, Ritchie Capital engaged in an illegal late trading scheme. Ritchie Capital placed thousands of late trades in mutual fund shares and used post-4 p.m. ET news and market information to make its mutual fund trading decisions while receiving the same dayâs net asset value for the mutual funds traded. Thane Ritchie approved the use of late trading by Ritchie Capitalâs mutual fund group and oversaw its performance. DeMaio supervised mutual fund trading at Ritchie Capital and was involved in the development of the late trading strategy. Mauriello was responsible for placing mutual fund late trades with brokers on behalf of Ritchie Capital. Ritchie Capitalâs post-4 p.m. trading resulted in a profit of approximately $30 million to the Ritchie Multi-Strategy fund. The Commissionâs Order requires Ritchie Multi-Strategy Global Trading Ltd. and Ritchie Capital Management LLC to pay disgorgement, jointly and severally, of $30 million, and prejudgment interest thereon of approximately $7.4 million. Ritchie Capital and Ritchie will pay civil penalties, jointly and severally, totaling $2.5 million. DeMaio will pay $250,000 in civil penalties. These payments will be distributed to the affected mutual funds. In addition to the disgorgement and civil penalties, the Commissionâs Order requires that Ritchie Capital, the Ritchie Multi-Strategy fund, Thane Ritchie and Warren DeMaio cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act, and that Ritchie Capital be censured and comply with certain undertakings. The Order also requires that Mauriello cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act. All respondents consented to the Commissionâs Order without admitting or denying the findings.

409,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement action against Nancy M. Tullos, the former vice president of human resources at Broadcom Corporation, for her participation in a five-year scheme to backdate stock options granted to Broadcom employees and officers. As a result of this scheme, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported an additional $2.22 billion in compensation expenses â the largest restatement to date arising from stock option backdating. ""Ms. Tullos personally benefited from the stock option backdating scheme that she facilitated in her role as head of Broadcom's human resources department,"" said Rosalind R. Tyson, Acting Regional Director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. ""The Commission will continue to aggressively pursue actions against individuals such as Ms. Tullos who engage in fraudulent options practices that mislead investors."" The Commission charged Tullos with participating in a scheme at Broadcom from 1998 to 2003 to backdate stock option grants to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the company's stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options to Tullos and numerous individuals. The SEC's complaint alleges that Tullos communicated false grant dates within the company and provided spreadsheets of stock option allocations for the backdated grants to Broadcom's finance and shareholder services departments, knowing that they would use such information to prepare Broadcom's books and records and periodic filings with the SEC. As a result, the complaint alleges that Tullos contributed to Broadcom's misrepresentations in these filings that no compensation expense was required for the stock option grants. Tullos personally benefited from the backdating scheme because she received and exercised backdated stock options that were in-the-money by more than $1.2 million. Under the settlement, Tullos agreed to pay more than $1.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, which will be offset by the value of her exercisable stock options that Broadcom cancelled. She agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. Tullos also will be enjoined from violations of an antifraud provision as well as aiding and abetting violations of the reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. Tullos agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.

410,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged fund manager Fidelity Investments and 13 current or former employees including high-ranking executives for improperly accepting more than $1.6 million in travel, entertainment, and other gifts paid for by outside brokers courting the massive trading business Fidelity generates on behalf of the mutual funds it manages. In a settled Order against Fidelity, the SEC charged that the firm failed to seek ""best execution"" â the most favorable terms reasonably available â for its clients' mutual funds securities transactions. The Order found that Fidelity allowed the selection of brokers to execute those transactions to be influenced by lavish gifts as well as family and romantic relationships with brokers. ""The broker selection process on Fidelity's equity trading desk was compromised when gifts and lavish entertainment swayed the flow of brokerage business,"" said Walter Ricciardi, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This misconduct created a serious risk of investor harm and violated Fidelity's duty of allegiance and loyalty to investors."" ""This case demonstrates again the SEC's commitment to preventing conflicts of interest from compromising the integrity of the markets,"" said David P. Bergers, Regional Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. ""Investment advisers must insist that brokerage firms compete for mutual fund business based on their ability to deliver best execution, not based on personal considerations like event tickets."" The SEC Order requires Fidelity to pay an $8 million penalty, which takes into account Fidelity's separate agreements with its mutual fund trustees and institutional and other clients to make additional payments. The SEC also censured Fidelity, ordered the firm to cease any further violations, and required Fidelity to hire an independent compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of Fidelity's current policies and procedures concerning equity trading operations, conflicts and gifts. Fidelity consented to the Order without admitting or denying the findings. According to the SEC Order, those charged received a host of travel, entertainment and other gifts paid for by outside brokers, including private jet trips to such places as Bermuda, Mexico, and Las Vegas and premium sports tickets to events including Wimbledon, the Super Bowl, and the Ryder Cup golf tournament. The individuals charged by the SEC include Scott E. DeSano, Fidelity's former senior vice president and head of global equity trading. Other executives charged were Bart A. Grenier, a senior vice president who held supervisory responsibility for Fidelity's equity trading desk and other business groups, and Peter Lynch, Fidelity's trustee, vice chairman and former portfolio manager of Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund. Grenier and Lynch settled the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. The SEC's Order against Lynch found that he obtained numerous free tickets to concerts, theater and sporting events paid for by outside brokers through his requests to two traders on Fidelity's equity trading desk, causing those traders to violate an Investment Company Act provision that bars accepting compensation from outside sources when transacting on behalf of a mutual fund. The Order requires Lynch to cease committing or causing any further violations and to pay $15,948 in disgorgement â equaling his ill-gotten gains â and prejudgment interest of $4,183. The SEC's Order against Grenier found that he violated the Investment Company Act in connection with his acceptance of $38,500 worth of tickets from brokers to 21 concerts and sporting events. The Order further finds that Grenier caused violations of the Investment Company Act by DeSano, through whom Grenier requested the tickets from brokers. The Order requires Grenier to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $26,316.89, and a $25,000 penalty. Grenier also was censured and ordered to cease further violations. DeSano still faces SEC charges along with nine current or former Fidelity equity traders: Thomas H. Bruderman, Edward S. Driscoll, Timothy J. Burnieika, Robert L. Burns, David K. Donovan, Jeffrey D. Harris, Christopher J. Horan, Steven P. Pascucci, and Kirk C. Smith. Former Fidelity equity trader Marc C. Beran settled the SEC's action against him without admitting or denying the charges. The SEC alleges that DeSano knew that certain Fidelity traders directed transactions to brokers who provided them with travel, entertainment and gifts, and also to brokers with whom certain Fidelity traders had a family or romantic relationship. On Dec. 1, 2006, the SEC brought a settled enforcement action against Jefferies & Co, Inc., its Director of Equities Scott Jones, and former Senior Vice President and equity sales trader Kevin Quinn in connection with Jefferies' provision of extravagant travel and entertainment, and other lavish gifts to Fidelity equity traders and DeSano in order to win securities brokerage business from the Fidelity mutual funds.

Led by Melnyk, Biovail intentionally misstated both the effect of the accident on Biovail's third quarter earnings as well as the value of the product involved in the truck accident. The accident, in fact, had no effect on third quarter earnings. The SEC's complaint also alleges three accounting schemes that affected reporting periods from 2001 to 2003. The SEC's complaint alleges that each of Biovail's fraudulent accounting schemes had a material effect on Biovail's financial statements for the relevant quarters and years and was engineered by Biovail's senior management in order to inflate Biovail's reported earnings. Biovail management also intentionally deceived the company's outside auditors as to the true nature of the transactions. The truck accident misstatements were intended to mislead investors about the significance of Biovail's failure to meet its own earnings guidance. According to the SEC's complaint, Melnyk violated shareholder disclosure provisions by failing to include in his Schedule 13D filings Biovail shares held by several off-shore trusts that Melnyk controlled. Because Melnyk exercised both investment and trading authority over the shares in the trusts, Melnyk was a beneficial owner of the securities and was required to disclose that ownership in his Schedule 13D filings with the SEC.

414,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Broadcom Corporation for falsifying its reported income by backdating stock option grants over a five-year period. As a result of the fraud, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported more than $2 billion in additional compensation expenses. The Irvine, Calif.-based semiconductor maker has agreed to settle the charges and consented to pay a $12 million penalty. ""The backdating scheme at Broadcom went on for five years, involved dozens of option grants, and resulted in the largest accounting restatement to date arising from stock option backdating,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The scope and magnitude of the fraud warrants the significant penalty imposed on the company."" Rosalind R. Tyson, Acting Regional Director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, added, ""Today's action highlights the ways in which certain companies have abused option grants. Broadcom used lucrative in-the-money grants to recruit and retain talented employees without paying them higher cash salaries, but avoided the requirement to report the billions of dollars in compensation expenses by secretly backdating the options."" In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC alleges that from June 1998 to May 2003, Broadcom, acting through its top officers, misrepresented the dates on which stock options were granted to executives and employees. Broadcom's Chairman and Chief Technology Officer along with its former CEO sat on the two-member option committee with authority to approve options to employees and all but the most senior executives, whose grants were to be decided by two independent directors comprising Broadcom's compensation committee. The SEC alleges that the option committee approved as many as 88 grants during the relevant period, but for many of these grants there was no meeting or decision made by the committee on the dates the grants were supposedly approved. Instead, Broadcom's former CFO allegedly selected many of the grant dates retroactively based on a comparison of Broadcom's historical stock prices, and the two option committee members allegedly concealed the backdating by signing false committee written consents stating that the grant had been approved ""as of"" the retroactive date. Through backdating, Broadcom made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of Broadcom's stock â despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved. This resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options. In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that the top officers â not the compensation committee â decided on option grants to Broadcom's executives and used hindsight to select the dates for them. According to the complaint, Broadcom's General Counsel directed the preparation of false board and compensation committee written consents to conceal some of these grants. The SEC further alleges that, as a result of the backdating scheme, Broadcom avoided reporting $2.22 billion in compensation expenses during the relevant period. Broadcom overstated its income by between 15 percent and 422 percent, and understated its loss by between 16 percent and 38 percent. The unrecorded compensation expenses and hidden backdating practices led Broadcom to provide false and misleading disclosures to its shareholders in filings with the SEC through 2005. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Broadcom agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws, and payment of the $12 million penalty. The settlement is subject to approval by the court. On March 4, 2008, the SEC brought an enforcement action against Broadcom's former vice president of human resources, Nancy M.

415,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Paul S. Berliner, a Wall Street trader formerly associated with Schottenfeld Group LLC, with securities fraud and market manipulation for intentionally spreading false rumors about The Blackstone Group's acquisition of Alliance Data Systems (ADS) while selling ADS short. The SEC alleges that five months ago, Berliner disseminated the false rumor through instant messages to numerous individuals, including traders at brokerage firms and hedge funds. The false rumor also was picked up by the media. Heavy trading in ADS stock ensued, and within 30 minutes the false rumor had caused the price of ADS stock, trading at approximately $77 per share, to plummet to an intraday low of $63.65 per share - a 17 percent decline. In response to the unusual trading activity, the New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading in ADS stock. Later in the day, ADS issued a press release announcing that the rumor was false. By the close of trading, the price of ADS stock recovered to its pre-rumor price of approximately $77 per share. Berliner profited by short selling ADS stock during its precipitous decline. ""The message of this case is simple and direct. The Commission will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who manipulate markets with this witch's brew of damaging rumors and short sales,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. ""Today's action makes clear that the Commission will act swiftly and decisively against those who would seek to profit by disseminating false information to the marketplace,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The story disseminated by Mr. Berliner was a figment of his imagination,"" said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Conduct like this is particularly insidious because it harms investors by distorting the information they use to make investment decisions."" The SEC's complaint alleges that on Nov. 29, 2007 - approximately six months after Blackstone entered into a definitive acquisition agreement for ADS at $81.75 per share - Berliner fabricated and disseminated a rumor that the acquisition was being renegotiated at $70 per share because of purported troubles in the company's consumer banking division, and the ADS Board was meeting to discuss the revised proposal. The complaint further alleges that around the same time Berliner began disseminating the false rumor to the marketplace, he started selling short ADS securities. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Berliner agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws, and requiring him to disgorge $26,129 in profits and interest, pay a maximum third-tier penalty of $130,000, and consent to the entry of a Commission Order barring him from association with any broker or dealer.",-0.4375,Negative
416,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former senior executives at Monster Worldwide, Inc., for their alleged participation in a multi-year scheme to secretly backdate stock options granted to thousands of Monster officers, directors and employees. The SECâs complaint, filed in the District Court for Southern District of New York, alleges that Monsterâs former president and chief operating officer James J. Treacy and former controller Anthony Bonica participated in a scheme that began in 1997 to fraudulently backdate stock options to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the New York-based companyâs common stock. âThese defendants circumvented disclosure requirements and accounting principles designed to provide investors with an accurate picture of a companyâs performance. Our enforcement action today demonstrates yet again that the Commission will not tolerate deception of investors through unlawful options backdating and will aggressively pursue those responsible,â said Linda Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThese individuals caused Monster to mislead its investors by failing to report hundreds of millions of dollars of expenses,â said Kay Lackey, Associate Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âThe Commission will continue to hold corporate executives accountable for such fraudulent actions.â The SEC is alleging that this scheme resulted in grants of in-the-money options to numerous individuals without Monster properly describing its options practices in its public filings or properly accounting for these options in its financial statements. As a result of their conduct, Monster misrepresented that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was not the case. Monster also filed materially misstated financial statements with the SEC in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the companyâs stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Monster overstated its aggregate pre-tax operating income by approximately $339.5 million for fiscal years 1997 through 2005. The SECâs complaint further alleges that Treacy and Bonica personally benefited from the fraudulent scheme by receiving and exercising backdated grants of in-the-money options. The SEC is charging Treacy and Bonica with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and with violating or aiding and abetting the violation of reporting requirements as well as other violations. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and financial penalties from each defendant, as well as an officer and director bar against Treacy. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which conducted their own separate, parallel investigation resulting in distinct criminal charges against Treacy.

417,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement action against Banc of America Investment Services, Inc. (BAISI) for failing to disclose to clients that in selecting investments for discretionary mutual fund wrap fee accounts, it favored two mutual funds affiliated with BAISI. The SEC also charged Columbia Management Advisors, LLC (Columbia), as successor to Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (BACAP), with aiding and abetting, and causing certain of BAISI's violations. As part of the settlement, BAISI and Columbia agreed to pay a total of nearly $10 million in disgorgement and penalties. The Commission ordered BAISI to distribute the settlement amount to affected clients. ""BAISI's selection of mutual funds for wrap fee clients was compromised when it favored its own proprietary funds over non-affiliated funds,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""By using a method to select funds that was at odds with information it provided to clients, BAISI violated its duty of loyalty to its clients."" Fredric Firestone, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""This Order serves to remind the investment adviser community that the Commission will not tolerate advisers placing their own pecuniary interests ahead of their clients'."" The Commission's Order finds that, from July 2002 through December 2004, BAISI made material misrepresentations and omissions to clients who had given BAISI discretion to select mutual funds for them. The clients participated in an asset-based or ""wrap"" fee program in which they paid BAISI a fee based upon the amount of their assets in exchange for BAISI providing advisory and other account services. BAISI had a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its clients, which required BAISI to disclose material information concerning conflicts of interest, and precluded it from undisclosed use of its clients' assets to benefit itself or its affiliates. In the Order, the Commission finds that BAISI purchased at least two proprietary ""Nations Funds"" for clients with discretionary wrap fee accounts using a methodology that was contrary to BAISI's disclosures to those clients. The Order also finds that BAISI omitted to disclose the scope of its and BACAP's conflict of interests, and their bias in the recommendation and selection process. BACAP earned additional fees as a result of these violations because it was paid management and other fees based on the total assets of Nations Funds. The Commission's Order finds that BAISI violated provisions of the Securities Act and the Advisers Act, and that Columbia aided and abetted, and caused certain of BAISI's violations of the Advisers Act. Under the terms of the settlement, BAISI and Columbia agreed to censures, cease-and-desist orders, and a total of $9,763,634 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties, which will be put into a Fair Fund to benefit affected clients of BAISI. The Order also requires BAISI to conduct a review of the firm's method for recommending and selecting mutual funds in discretionary programs, and the adequacy of its disclosures in this area.",-0.25,Negative
418,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed enforcement actions against global advertising network McCann-Erickson Worldwide, its parent company, and two former executives for their roles in an accounting fraud involving intercompany transactions. The SEC's complaint alleges that McCann, which owns hundreds of regional and local advertising agencies throughout the world, fraudulently misstated its financial results by improperly failing to expense intercompany charges that were instead recorded as receivables. Its holding company, Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG), negligently failed to address the accounting problems at McCann, its largest subsidiary, resulting in material misstatements in its own financial reporting. IPG and McCann agreed to settle the SEC's charges, and McCann agreed to pay a $12 million penalty. Linda Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""A subsidiary that feeds misleading financial results to its parent defrauds the parent's public shareholders and will be held accountable."" Mark Schonfeld, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""McCann ignored its intercompany problems year after year, and even worse purposely avoided addressing the problems to ensure it hit profit targets."" Also charged in a separate settled enforcement action were Salvatore LaGreca of Port Washington, N.Y., and Brian Watson, a resident of the United Kingdom. LaGreca served as McCann's Vice Chairman of Finance and Operations and its CFO from January 1996 to October 2002, and oversaw McCann's accounting, financial reporting, strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and budgeting. Watson, a resident of the United Kingdom, joined McCann's European-Middle East-Africa region (EMEA) as Director of Operations in 1996. Although he was not an accountant, he handled many aspects of the financial responsibilities when EMEA did not have a Finance Director. The SEC's complaints allege that IPG restated its financial results in the fall of 2002 in the amount of $181 million for the period 1997 to 2002. The 2002 restatement was largely attributable to the fact that McCann had failed to report accurately its intercompany transactions. McCann officers and employees, including LaGreca and Watson, failed to ensure McCann reconciled its intercompany accounts for at least six years. At times, LaGreca and Watson purposely delayed reconciling intercompany accounts because they knew restatements would result in write-offs that would interfere with McCann's efforts to hit internal annual profit targets. Because McCann never fully reconciled its intercompany accounts and failed to expense properly intercompany charges, McCann's financial results were inaccurate. As LaGreca and Watson knew, IPG then incorporated McCann's financial results in IPG's consolidated financial statements. According to the SEC's complaint, IPG's financial reporting problems were not resolved in 2002. In September 2005, IPG again restated its pre-tax income for the years 2000 through 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 in the amount of $420 million. A large portion of this restatement was related to $199 million of improperly recognized revenue related to Agency Volume Bonifications (AVBs) and other vendor discounts and credits that IPG took in violation of its contracts with certain of its clients. The 2005 restatement was necessary due to a substantial breakdown of internal controls at IPG and its numerous subsidiaries, including McCann. IPG filed numerous Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and registration statements that contained misrepresentations due to the intercompany issues, the AVB issues, and the various other issues reflected in the 2002 and 2005 restatements. IPG, McCann, LaGreca and Watson agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. IPG agreed to consent to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. In addition to the $12 million penalty, McCann agreed to consent to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted IPG's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13. LaGreca and Watson agreed to consent to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violation of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. LaGreca and Watson also agreed to pay penalties of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively, and pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $46,947 and $17,325, respectively.",-0.5769230769230769,Negative

421,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two current and two former top officers of Irvine, Calif.-based Broadcom Corporation for their alleged participation in a five-year systematic scheme to secretly backdate stock options granted to virtually all Broadcom officers and employees. The SECâs complaint, filed in federal district court for the Central District of California, alleges that Broadcomâs former chief executive officer Henry T. Nicholas, chairman and chief technology officer Henry Samueli, former chief financial officer William J. Ruehle, and general counsel David Dull perpetrated a scheme from 1998 to 2003 to fraudulently backdate stock option grants, failing to record billions of dollars of compensation expenses and falsifying documents to further the fraud. As a result of the scheme, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported more than $2 billion in additional compensation expenses. âAs alleged in the complaint, the executives at Broadcom perpetrated a massive, five-year scheme that involved fraudulent backdating of dozens of option grants, falsifying corporate records, intentionally false accounting, and lying to shareholders,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThis egregious misconduct resulted in the largest accounting restatement to date arising from stock option backdating and warrants the significant sanctions sought from these individuals.â Rosalind R. Tyson, Acting Regional Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office, added, âThe defendants caused Broadcom to deprive its shareholders and the market of accurate information regarding executive compensation and the companyâs accounting for stock options.â The SEC alleges that, through this scheme, the four officers made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of Broadcomâs stock â despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved. This resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options. The SEC also alleges that the unrecorded compensation expenses and hidden backdating practices led Broadcom to provide false and misleading disclosures to Broadcomâs shareholders in filings with the SEC through 2005. According to the SECâs complaint, Nicholas and Samueli served on the two-member option committee that had authority to approve options to employees and all but the most senior officers, whose grants were to be decided by two independent directors comprising Broadcomâs compensation committee. The SEC alleges that the option committee approved as many as 88 grants during the relevant period, but for many of the grants the committee neither held meetings nor made decisions on the dates the grants were supposedly approved. Instead, Ruehle allegedly selected most of the grant dates retroactively based on a comparison of Broadcomâs historical stock prices, and Nicholas and Samueli allegedly concealed the backdating by signing false committee written consents stating that the grant had been approved âas ofâ the retroactive date. In addition, the SEC alleges that Nicholas, Samueli, and Ruehle â not the compensation committee â decided on option grants to Broadcomâs senior officers and used hindsight to select the dates for them. Dull allegedly knew about and participated in the backdating scheme and was involved in the preparation, review, and approval of false board and compensation committee meeting documents to conceal two backdated grants in 2001, one of which awarded him options to purchase 300,000 shares. The SEC is alleging that Ruehle and Dull each personally benefited from the backdating scheme by receiving and exercising backdated grants that were in-the-money by more than $100,000 for Ruehle and $1.8 million for Dull. The SEC is charging Nicholas, Samueli, Ruehle, and Dull with violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC also alleges that Nicholas and Ruehle violated the proxy and false statements to auditors provisions and signed certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading concerning Broadcomâs 2002 through 2005 periodic reports. In addition, the SEC alleges that Ruehle and Dull violated the securities ownership reporting provisions. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, civil monetary penalties, and officer-and-director bars against each of the individuals, disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Ruehle and Dull, and reimbursement of bonuses and profits from stock sales from Nicholas and Ruehle pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Previously, the Commission brought enforcement actions against Broadcom and Broadcomâs former vice president of human resources, Nancy M. Tullos, in connection with the option backdating scheme.

422,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement action charging Willbros Group, Inc. and four former employees with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), alleging that they paid more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to Nigerian government officials and others to obtain significant contracts for the Houston-based company. Willbros Group has agreed to pay $10.3 million to settle the SECâs charges, and the four other defendants also agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the allegations. The SECâs complaint names Jason Steph, a former supervisory employee in Nigeria; Gerald Jansen, a former administrative supervisor in Nigeria; Lloyd Biggers, a former employee in Nigeria; and Carlos Galvez, a former accounting employee in Bolivia. âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs continued vigorous enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SECâs Fort Worth Regional Office. âWe will not allow companies to use illicit payments to alter the competitive balance of the marketplace, as alleged here.â The anti-bribery provisions of FCPA prohibit corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, and the corresponding accounting provisions in the federal securities laws require adequate disclosure of payments. The SEC alleges that, beginning in at least 2003, Willbros Group engaged in a scheme to pay more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to Nigerian government officials and employees of an operator of a joint venture majority-owned by the Nigerian government in order to obtain two significant contracts that resulted in net profits of nearly $9 million. The SECâs complaint further alleges that Willbros Group and former employees used fabricated invoices to obtain cash from the companyâs Houston headquarters to bribe Nigerian tax and court officials. The SECâs complaint also alleges that Willbros Group and employees schemed to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil-and-gas company owned by the Ecuador government in order to obtain a $3 million contract, and implemented a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme in Bolivia that resulted in material misstatements in Willbros Groupâs financial statements. The SEC alleges that Willbros Group violated Sections 30A, 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Willbros Group has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of these provisions and an order to pay $8.9 million disgorgement, plus $1.4 million in prejudgment interest. The SEC alleges that Stephâs actions in Nigeria violated Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act. Steph consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of these provisions. Pursuant to the judgment, the court will determine later whether Steph will pay a penalty. The SEC alleges that Jansenâs role in the Nigerian bribes violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act. He has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of these provisions and to an order to pay a $30,000 civil penalty. The SEC alleges that the conduct of Biggers in Nigeria violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 30A of the Exchange Act. He has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of these provisions. The SEC alleges that the conduct of Galvez in Bolivia violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Galvez has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of these provisions and an order to pay a $35,000 civil penalty. The Commission acknowledges Willbros Group's cooperation in the investigation. In a related criminal proceeding, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement in the Southern District of Texas relating to the criminal FCPA charges against Willbros Group and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. (Willbros International). In that case, Willbros Group and Willbros International accepted responsibility for its employees that had violated the FCPA and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $22 million. Pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the Department of Justice agreed to defer prosecution of these companies for three years and the companies agreed to retain for a period of three years an independent compliance monitor to assess the companyâs implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and procedures.

423,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief to protect investors whose funds were at risk due to fraudulent misconduct at North American Clearing, Inc., a Longwood, Fla., based general securities and clearing brokerage firm. North American Clearing services approximately 40 correspondent brokers and clears transactions for over 10,000 customer accounts. The SEC requested the relief when it filed a complaint on May 27, 2008, against North American Clearing, its founder and director Richard L. Goble, its president Bruce B. Blatman, and its former financial and operations principal Timothy J. Ward, charging them with fraud and other securities laws violations. The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in illegal activities, including the misuse of customer funds, in order to hide North American Clearing's financial problems and to pay for its daily business operations. In addition to the asset freeze, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order against the defendants and an order appointing a receiver over North American Clearing. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Protecting customer funds from misuse by a broker-dealer, as we allege here, is a fundamental part of our enforcement efforts. Today's action demonstrates our ongoing commitment to investor protection."" David Nelson, Director of the SEC's Miami Regional Office, added, ""The federal securities laws include important safeguards designed to protect investor assets from misuse by broker-dealers. We will take swift action to protect investors when misconduct occurs that puts their money at risk."" The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants' fraud began earlier this year, when North American Clearing began experiencing severe financial problems. To ease its financial difficulties, North American Clearing secured a bank loan using customer securities as collateral. To comply with the federal securities laws and remain in operation, North American Clearing increased its reserves in an account it maintained for the benefit of customers, which limited funds available to North American Clearing to meet its daily operating expenses. According to the SEC's complaint, on several occasions in March and April 2008, North American Clearing improperly sold customer money market funds as a means of temporarily freeing up funds that it then used to pay for daily operating expenses. The SEC's complaint also alleges that on May 13, 2008, the defendants manipulated North American Clearing's processing system to overstate net customer money market purchases. This enabled North American Clearing to illegally withdraw more than $3 million from the reserves it was required to maintain for the benefit of customers. The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando, seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against North American Clearing and Goble, and civil penalties against all defendants. The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud, customer protection and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 27, 2008, the Honorable Gregory A. Presnell granted the SEC's ex parte motion for emergency relief, entering a temporary restraining order against the defendants and freezing North American Clearing's assets. The order also provides for a sworn accounting from North American Clearing and preservation of its records. The Court further appointed Peter J. Anderson, an attorney in the law firm of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP of Atlanta, Ga., as a receiver over North American Clearing. Among other things, the receiver is responsible for marshaling and safeguarding assets held by North American Clearing. A show cause hearing has been set for June 6, 2008, to determine whether the emergency asset freeze and other relief should remain in effect.

The SEC's insider trading case alleges that from approximately summer 2006 through fall 2007, James E. Gansman, a former partner in Ernst & Young's Transaction Advisory Services department, tipped his friend Donna Murdoch about the identities of at least seven different acquisition targets of clients who sought valuation services from his firm. According to the SEC's complaint, Murdoch used the non-public information to trade in the securities of the target companies; to tip her father, who also traded; and to make recommendations to two others, who traded as well. ""This case underscores how important it is for deal advisers and due diligence providers retained by acquirers and their targets to respect the confidentiality of the information shared with them,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. According to the SEC's complaint, Gansman misappropriated the information about pending acquisitions on numerous occasions in breach of a duty of confidentiality owed to E&Y and its clients. Murdoch was a registered securities professional and managing director of a Philadelphia-based broker-dealer and investment banking firm. The complaint alleges that she used the non-public information provided by Gansman to tip her father, Gerald L. Brodsky, who also is named as a defendant, and to make recommendations to two others. According to the complaint, Murdoch traded in the securities of at least seven companies based on the non-public information that they were acquisition targets of E&Y's clients, resulting in at least $392,035 in illegal profits. She provided information about one of the pending acquisitions, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., to Brodsky, who traded on this information through a nominee account. His illegal profits totaled $63,400. The complaint alleges that Murdoch also recommended trading in the securities of two of the target companies, Freescale and ATI Technologies, Inc., to other individuals who traded for profits of $140,760. The SEC complaint alleges that each of the three defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants Gansman and Murdoch also violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of unlawful trading profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

425,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM) portfolio managers for fraudulently misleading investors about the financial state of the firm's two largest hedge funds and their exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities before the collapse of the funds in June 2007. The SEC's complaint alleges that when the hedge funds took increasing hits to the value of their portfolios during the first five months of 2007 and faced escalating redemptions and margin calls, then-BSAM senior managing directors Ralph R. Cioffi and Matthew M. Tannin deceived their own investors and certain institutional counterparties about the funds' growing troubles until they collapsed and caused investor losses of approximately $1.8 billion. The SEC's action was conducted through its Enforcement Division's subprime working group, which is aggressively investigating possible fraud, market manipulation, and breaches of fiduciary duty that may have contributed to the recent turmoil in the credit markets. In a related criminal action today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the indictment of Cioffi and Tannin on conspiracy and fraud charges. ""Hedge fund managers owe serious obligations to investors in their funds, and the Commission will be unyielding in its commitment to vigorous investor protection by enforcing the securities laws against them whenever warranted,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. ""Hedge funds are by no means unregulated when it comes to fraud. Those who commit fraud at the expense of investors will always be the target of a relentless SEC."" Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Hedge fund managers remain subject to the same prohibitions against fraud as other market participants. When they choose to make public statements, they must not speak falsely or omit material information."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Hedge fund managers cannot lie to their own investors as alleged here, simply because those investors happen to be more sophisticated than the general public. Particularly in times of poor performance or market difficulty, even sophisticated investors look to fund managers to speak truthfully to them."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund collapsed after taking highly leveraged positions in structured securities based largely on subprime mortgage-backed securities. Cioffi acted as senior portfolio manager and Tannin acted as portfolio manager and chief operating officer for the funds, and they misrepresented the funds' deteriorating condition and the level of investor redemption requests in order to bring in new money and keep existing investors and institutional counterparties from withdrawing money. For example, Cioffi misrepresented the funds' April 2007 monthly performance by releasing insufficiently qualified estimates â based only on a subset of the funds' portfolios â that projected essentially flat returns. Final returns released several weeks later revealed actual April losses of 5.09 percent for the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and 18.97 percent for the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund. The SEC's complaint alleges that Cioffi and Tannin also misrepresented their funds' investment in subprime mortgage-backed securities. Monthly written performance summaries highlighted direct subprime exposure as typically about 6 to 8 percent of each fund's portfolio. However, after the funds had collapsed, the BSAM sales force was ultimately told that total subprime exposure â direct and indirect â was approximately 60 percent. The SEC further alleges that Cioffi and Tannin continually exaggerated their own investments in the funds while using their personal stake as a selling point to investors. Tannin repeatedly told investors, directly and through the Bear Stearns sales force, that he was adding to his own stake in the funds in order to take advantage of the buying ""opportunity"" presented by the funds' losses. Tannin never actually added to his investment. He mocked as ""silly"" at least one investor who sought to redeem instead of following Tannin's supposed example. Meanwhile, Cioffi redeemed $2 million, which was more than one-third of his personal investment in the funds at the end of March 2007. Cioffi transferred it to another BSAM fund that he described as ""short sub prime,"" which he knew was profitable at the time. The Commission alleges in its complaint that Cioffi and Tannin violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. The Commission appreciates the cooperation of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducted a separate, parallel investigation.

428,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New Hampshire-based Pax World Management Corp. with violating investment restrictions in socially responsible mutual funds that investors were told would not contain securities issued by companies involved with producing weapons, alcohol, tobacco or gambling products. The SEC alleges that Pax World, the SEC-registered investment adviser to several socially responsible mutual funds, including the Pax World Growth Fund and Pax World High Yield Fund, purchased at least 10 securities that the Funds' socially responsible investing (SRI) restrictions prohibited them from buying â contrary to representations it made to investors and the boards of the Funds. Pax World agreed to settle the SEC's charges and was ordered to pay a penalty of $500,000. ""Advisers simply cannot tell investors they are going to do one thing with their funds and then not follow through on those promises,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This is particularly true with socially responsible mutual funds because their stated investment restrictions are likely the primary reason an investor chooses to invest in these funds in the first place."" David Bergers, Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, added, ""Mutual fund companies marketing socially responsible funds should take care that their representations to investors match their investments. Like all investment advisers, advisers to socially responsible funds must have adequate procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with the funds' stated investment restrictions."" According to the SEC's order, Pax World violated the Funds' SRI restrictions by making purchases in the securities of companies that derived revenue from the manufacture of alcohol or gambling products, derived more than 5 percent of their revenue from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, or failed to satisfy the Funds' environmental or labor standards. Pax World Funds held at least one security that violated their SRI restrictions at all times from 2001 through early 2006. For example: In 2003, Pax World purchased for the Growth Fund securities issued by an oil and gas exploration company that had failed its three most recent screens. In 2004, Pax World purchased for the High Yield Fund securities issued by a conglomerate primarily engaged in the shipping industry but which derived revenue from gambling and the manufacture of liquor. The SEC also alleged that Pax World failed to consistently follow its own internal SRI-related policies and procedures that required that all new securities be screened by Pax World's Social Research Department prior to purchase to ensure compliance with the funds' SRI disclosures. Pax World failed to screen 8 percent of all new security purchases from 2001 to 2005. Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC's Order, Pax World agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from any further violations of certain antifraud, false filing, and other provisions of the securities laws in addition to paying the $500,000 penalty. The Commission's settlement takes into account the remedial acts undertaken by Pax World as well as its cooperation.

429,"The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement today announced a preliminary settlement in principle with Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Citi) including proposed charges and a plan that would give individual investors, small businesses, and charities all $7.5 billion of their money back from auction rate securities (ARS) they purchased from the firm. The agreement also would require Citi to use its best efforts to liquidate by the end of 2009 all of the approximately $12 billion worth of ARS the firm sold to retirement plans and other institutional investors. The ARS market collapsed in mid-February 2008, leaving tens of thousands of Citi customers holding nearly $20 billion of these illiquid securities for an indefinite period of time. The conduct underlying the proposed charges stems from Citi's marketing of ARS to many of its customers as highly liquid investments, including as money market investments. The liquidity of these securities, however, was premised on Citi providing support bids for auctions it managed when there was not enough customer demand. When Citi stopped supporting auctions in February 2008, there were widespread auction failures. As a result, thousands of Citi customers were left holding illiquid securities. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Today's agreement in principle provides real relief to investors. In a short period of time, about 38,000 individual, small business, and charitable organization investor accounts will receive nearly $7.5 billion in liquidity, and Citi will begin the process of restoring liquidity to over 2,600 institutional investors who hold approximately $12 billion in auction rate securities. This settlement in principle is an outstanding example of federal and state regulatory cooperation for the benefit of investors and markets."" The terms of the agreement in principle, which are subject to finalization, review and approval by the Commission: Citi will be permanently enjoined from violating the provisions of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, which prohibit the use of manipulative or deceptive devices by broker-dealers. Citi will liquidate at par all ARS from its retail customers, which include all natural persons, charities, and small businesses, no later than three months from today. Citi will make whole any losses sustained by customers who purchased ARS before Feb. 12, 2008, and sold such securities after that date at a loss. Citi will use its best efforts to liquidate ARS from its institutional customers by the end of 2009. Until Citi actually provides for the liquidation of the securities on the schedule set forth above, Citi will provide no-cost loans to customers that will remain outstanding until the ARS are repurchased, and will reimburse customers for any interest costs incurred under any prior loan programs the firm provided to its ARS customers. Citi will not liquidate its own inventory of a particular ARS before it liquidates its customers' holding in that security. To the extent that a customer has incurred consequential damages beyond the loss of liquidity in the customer's holdings of ARS (which should be restored pursuant to the settlement terms above), Citi will participate in a special arbitration process that the customer may elect, and that will be overseen by FINRA, whereby Citi will not contest liability for its misrepresentations and omissions concerning the ARS, but may challenge the existence or amount of any consequential damages; the arbitration claim will be heard by a single, non-industry arbitrator. This arbitration process will be voluntary on the part of the customer and if a customer elects not to take advantage of these special procedures, a customer may pursue all other arbitration or legal or equitable remedies available through any other administrative or judicial process available to the customer. Citi will provide notice to all customers of the settlement terms. Citi will establish a telephone assistance line, with appropriate staffing, to respond to questions from customers concerning the terms of the settlement. Citi faces the prospect of a financial penalty to the SEC after it has completed its obligations under the settlement agreement. Determinations as to the amount of the penalty, if any, will take into account, among other things, an assessment of whether Citi has satisfactorily completed its obligations under the settlement, and the costs incurred by Citi in meeting those obligations, including penalties incurred and the cost of remediation.

433,"The Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Enforcement today announced a preliminary settlement in principle with UBS Securities LLC and UBS Financial Services, Inc. (collectively, UBS) including proposed charges and a plan that would restore approximately $22 billion in liquidity to its customers who invested in auction rate securities (ARS). This plan includes approximately $8.2 billion for individual investors, small businesses, and charitable organizations, $3.3 billion for holders of tax-exempt Auction Preferred Shares (subject to regulatory review), and $10.3 billion for institutional investors. The ARS market collapsed in mid-February 2008, leaving over 40,000 UBS customers holding these illiquid securities indefinitely. The conduct underlying the proposed charges stems from UBSs marketing of auction rate securities as cash alternatives. However, the liquidity of these securities was premised on UBS providing support bids for auctions it managed when there was not enough customer demand, but this was not adequately disclosed to customers. When UBS stopped supporting auctions in February 2008, it led to widespread auction failures for UBS customers. Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECs Division of Enforcement, said, The Divisions agreement in principle with UBS, if approved by the Commission, will quickly restore liquidity to tens of thousands of UBS investors. In a short time, approximately 31,300 individual, charitable, and small business investor accounts will receive more than $8.2 billion in liquidity, and approximately 9,200 investor accounts holding tax-exempt Auction Preferred Shares will receive nearly $3.3 billion in liquidity. UBS also will begin the process of restoring $10.3 billion in liquidity to approximately 1,000 institutional investor accounts. The terms of the agreement in principle, which are subject to finalization, review and approval by the Commission, provide: The Commission notes the substantial assistance and cooperation from the New York Attorney General, FINRA, and the North American Securities Administrators Association.

434,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Wextrust Capital, LLC (Wextrust), its principals, and four affiliated Wextrust entities, alleging that defendants conducted a massive Ponzi-type scheme from 2005 or earlier that raised approximately $255 million from approximately 1,200 investors. The targets of the fraudulent offerings are primarily members of the Orthodox Jewish community. Simultaneous with the filing of the action, the Commission is seeking emergency relief from the Court to freeze the defendants' assets and place the Wextrust entities under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets. The Commission is also seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the ongoing offerings and other immediate relief. Scott Friestad, Deputy Director of Enforcement, said, ""This case demonstrates that the Commission will aggressively seek out and pursue affinity frauds. It is also a signal to investors to be wary of friends touting great investment 'opportunities.' In this case, Wextrust purported to be 'a globally diversified private equity and specialty finance company, specializing in investment opportunities ranging from real estate to specialty finance and investment banking.' The reality, as alleged in our complaint, was very different."" Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of Enforcement, added, ""Our complaint alleges an affinity fraud of very large scale. In this case, one of the defendants used his extensive connections in the orthodox Jewish community to solicit more than $250 million from unsuspecting investors. Affinity frauds are especially pernicious because the victims tend to let their guards down in circumstances where they might otherwise proceed with much more caution."" The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges that Wextrust, its principals Steven Byers and Joseph Shereshevsky, and its affiliated entities Wextrust Equity Partners, LLC (WEP), Wextrust Development Group, LLC (WDG), Wextrust Securities, LLC (Wextrust Securities) and Axela Hospitality, LLC (Axela) conducted at least 60 securities offerings through private placements and created approximately 150 entities in the form of limited liability companies or similar vehicles to act as issuers or facilitators of the offerings, purportedly to fund the acquisition of specified assets, the majority of which were commercial real estate ventures. Contrary to representations in the offering memoranda that proceeds would be used for specific projects, the defendants allegedly diverted funds to pay returns to investors in prior offerings, or to fund expenses of the defendants. In one offering, conducted in 2005, the SEC complaint alleges that defendants falsely represented to investors that the more than $9 million raised would be used to purchase seven specifically identified real estate properties that were leased by federal government agencies, such as the General Services Administration. In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants never purchased the seven properties. Moreover, at the time the offering occurred, they knew or were reckless in not knowing that the seven properties would not be acquired. Significantly, while the offering was ongoing, the Wextrust entities ""borrowed"" more than $6 million from the funds raised in the GSA offering and used these funds for purposes unrelated to the GSA offering. Overall, the complaint alleges, defendants diverted at least $100 million dollars to unauthorized purposes. The complaint alleges that the defendants are conducting at least four ongoing offering frauds intended to raise money to pay back investors from prior offerings. In addition to the emergency relief sought today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint names the following defendants. Byers, age 46, is a resident of Oakbrook, Ill., and owns sixty percent of Wextrust.

436,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc. (KBR) executive Albert Jackson Stanley with violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and related provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission alleges that over a 10-year period, Stanley and others participated in a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials in order to obtain construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. The contracts were awarded to a four-company joint venture of which The M.W. Kellogg Company, and later KBR, was a member. âAs this case demonstrates, the SEC is committed to holding violators accountable when they engage in illegal conduct to obtain business in foreign countries,â said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, Stanley and other members of the joint venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to individuals within the Nigerian government in order to obtain contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities (LNG Trains) in Bonny Island, Nigeria. Stanley and others met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe payments. To conceal the illicit payments, Stanley and others approved entering into sham contracts with two âagentsâ to funnel money to the Nigerian officials. Thereafter, as the joint venture was paid for its work building the LNG Trains, the joint venture paid the agents more than $180 million. In turn, substantial payments were made to various Nigerian government officials. âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs continued vigorous enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Antonia Chion, an Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe FCPA prohibits both direct bribes and those that are made through intermediaries.â Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stanley has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the anti-bribery, record-keeping and internal control provisions of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1). Stanley also has agreed to cooperate with the SECâs ongoing investigation. The proposed settlement with Stanley is subject to the courtâs approval. In a related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Stanley for conspiring to violate the FCPA and conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud. Stanley has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud (unrelated to the FCPA charge). He faces seven years in prison and payment of $10.8 million in restitution. âThe Department of Justice is committed to aggressively enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich. âTodayâs plea demonstrates that corporate executives who bribe foreign government officials in return for lucrative business deals can expect to face prosecution.â The Commissionâs investigation is continuing.

437,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Wall Street brokers with defrauding their customers when making more than $1 billion in unauthorized purchases of subprime-related auction rate securities. The SEC's Division of Enforcement in 2007 formed a subprime working group, which is aggressively investigating possible fraud, market manipulation, and breaches of fiduciary duty that may have contributed to the recent turmoil in the credit markets. The SEC alleges that Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler misled customers into believing that auction rate securities being purchased in their accounts were backed by federally guaranteed student loans and were a safe and liquid alternative to bank deposits or money market funds. Instead, the securities that Tzolov and Butler purchased for their customers were backed by subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and other non-student loan collateral.

Tzolov and Butler also routinely deleted references to ""CDO"" or ""Mortgage"" from the names of the securities in these e-mails.

439,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Lion Gate Capital, Inc. and its principal Kenneth Rickel with illegal short selling in the securities of 14 publicly traded companies. From January 2005 through September 2006, Lion Gate and Rickel allegedly used shares purchased in 14 registered public offerings to cover short sales that occurred during the five business days before the pricing of those offerings (the restricted period). The Commissionâs complaint alleges that this conduct violates Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which helps prevent abusive short selling and market manipulation. The SEC alleges that in each instance, Lion Gate and Rickel engaged in transactions that created the appearance that the shares covering the restricted period short sales were purchased on the open market. âThe Commission is committed to curbing the abuse of short selling,â said Linda Thomsen, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âTraders who attempt to hide their violations of the securities laws through sham transactions or other schemes will be held accountable.â Rosalind R. Tyson, Regional Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office, said âAs alleged in the complaint, Lion Gate and Rickel engaged in serial violations of an important regulation designed to protect the integrity of the capital markets. Through cases such as this one, the Commission is working to ensure that prices in public offerings are not influenced by inappropriate short selling activity.â According to the SECâs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Lion Gate and Rickel realized profits of at least $207,291 from their illegal trading. Rickel, who resides in Los Angeles, is the president, sole owner, and sole employee of Lion Gate, which is in the business of trading securities. According to the complaint, Rickel made every trading decision and placed every one of the violative trades. At the time of the conduct outlined in the SECâs complaint, Rule 105 prohibited covering a short sale made during the restricted period with securities purchased in a registered offering. Rule 105 was designed to prevent manipulative short selling prior to registered public offerings and to promote offering prices based upon open market prices, as determined by supply and demand rather than artificial forces. Short sellers who violated Rule 105 largely could avoid market risk by using shares purchased at a discount in a registered offering to cover restricted-period short sales.

440,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former senior executives at Duane Reade with fraud for orchestrating multi-million dollar accounting schemes that caused the company to inflate its reported earnings and overstate its net income. Duane Reade is the operator of the largest chain of drug stores in the New York Metropolitan area. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the former Duane Reade executives entered into a series of fraudulent transactions designed to boost reported income and enable the company to meet quarterly and annual earnings guidance. According to the SEC's complaint, the fraudulent transactions were designed by the company's former CEO, Anthony J. Cuti, and primarily implemented by its former Real Estate Administrator and one-time CFO, William J. Tennant. ""This case demonstrates that pursuit of accounting fraud continues to be a priority of the Commission, which will hold corporate officials accountable for misconduct,"" said Scott Friestad, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of Enforcement in the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""The Commission is committed to taking action against corporate executives who fraudulently seek to manage earnings, whether through sham, round-trip transactions as alleged in this case, or other means."" The SEC's complaint alleges that the earnings inflation scheme lasted from 2000 through 2004, and involved two kinds of transactions: the ""Real Estate Concession"" transactions and the ""Credit and Rebilling"" transactions. The Real Estate Concession transactions involved payments to Duane Reade for its agreement to relinquish purportedly valuable leases or other real-estate rights. The complaint alleges that these agreements were in reality a sham and that most transactions involved round-trip payments in which Cuti persuaded counterparties to make payments to Duane Reade in exchange for his promise to repay them through other fictitious transactions. The complaint further alleges that Tennant prepared the false documentation used to implement the scheme. In the Credit and Rebilling scheme, Cuti allegedly engineered different round-trip transactions that he designed to produce additional current income. The SEC's complaint charges that, at Cuti's direction, Duane Reade vendors issued bogus credits to the company that were booked as a reduction to current expenses, resulting in a corresponding increase to current income. However, Cuti also directed these vendors to rebill Duane Reade for the credited amount in later periods under fictitious invoices. Accordingly, when Duane Reade later paid the vendors for phantom services, the fictitious credits were reversed. To disguise the connection between the invoice payments and the original credits, and to ensure that the payments could be capitalized and amortized, rather than charged against current income, Cuti allegedly had the vendors submit the fictitious invoices for work performed on a construction or maintenance project different from that on which the vendor had issued the credits. According to the SEC's complaint, these schemes together caused Duane Reade to overstate its pre-tax income by a total of approximately $17.5 million. To assure the success of the Real Estate Concession scheme in inflating reported income, Cuti and Tennant are alleged to have intentionally deceived the company's CFO and other members of management. Cuti also allegedly made false statements and omitted material facts in conversations with and written representations to the company's independent auditors as to the true nature of the Real Estate Concession and Credit and Rebilling transactions. The SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining both Cuti and Tennant from future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The SEC also seeks a judgment barring them from serving as officers or directors of any public company.

The Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleges that in June 2004, Mamma.com Inc. invited Cuban to participate in the stock offering after he agreed to keep the information confidential. The complaint further alleges that Cuban knew that the offering would be conducted at a discount to the prevailing market price and that it would be dilutive to existing shareholders. Within hours of receiving this information, according to the complaint, Cuban called his broker and instructed him to sell Cuban's entire position in the company. When the offering was publicly announced, Mamma.com's stock price opened at $11.89, down $1.215 or 9.3 percent from the prior day's closing price of $13.105.

442,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Dallas entrepreneur Mark Cuban with insider trading for selling 600,000 shares of the stock of an Internet search engine company on the basis of material, non-public information concerning an impending stock offering.

443,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four individuals for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to overvalue the commodity derivatives trading portfolio at Bank of Montreal (BMO), and thereby inflate BMO's publicly reported financial results. The defendants include a former senior derivatives trader at BMO and the top two senior executive officers of Optionable, Inc., a publicly traded commodities brokerage firm. The SEC's complaint alleges that David Lee, formerly the Managing Director of BMO's Commodity Derivatives Group, fraudulently overvalued BMO's portfolio of natural gas options by deliberately ""mismarking"" trading positions for which market prices were unavailable. Lee recorded inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, which held itself out to BMO and the public as a legitimate provider of independent derivatives valuation services. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Lee schemed with Optionable's CEO Kevin Cassidy, Optionable's president Edward O'Connor, and Optionable broker Connor to have Optionable simply rubber-stamp whatever inflated values Lee recorded. After the scheme was discovered, BMO restated its financial results by reducing net income for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year by approximately $237 million Canadian dollars ($204 million U.S. dollars), which reflects a 68 percent overstatement of BMO's net income for that quarter. ""As alleged in our complaint, these defendants engaged in an elaborate scheme to overvalue illiquid assets held on the books of a publicly traded bank,"" said Linda Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Today's enforcement action underscores the Commission's commitment to rooting out such deceptive schemes and protecting the integrity of the financial markets."" David Rosenfeld, Associate Director of the SEC's New York Office, added, ""The Commission will take aggressive action when financial professionals engage in collusive schemes to overvalue assets. These schemes harm public shareholders and undermine confidence in our markets."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, BMO was Optionable's largest customer, and BMO trades accounted for as much as 60 percent of Optionable's commodity brokerage business. Lee's trading accounted for virtually all of BMO's business with Optionable. As a result, Optionable's management, led by Cassidy, allegedly was willing to do whatever it took to keep Lee satisfied. When market prices were unavailable, BMO's risk management personnel sought to verify the accuracy of BMO's commodity derivatives traders' valuations of their positions, or their ""marks,"" by obtaining supposedly independent valuations, or ""quotes,"" for those positions from one or more third parties. The SEC's complaint alleges that during the relevant period, Optionable was the primary source of the third-party quotes that BMO used to validate Lee's marks. The SEC alleges that Lee provided his marks directly to Cassidy, O'Connor, or Connor, who then simply forwarded Lee's marks virtually unchanged to BMO's risk management department as if they were Optionable's independent quotes. At first, Lee allegedly used this ""u-turn"" scheme to boost his trading profits and incentive compensation, but in 2006, the market turned against Lee and he used the scheme to hide substantial trading losses. In May 2007, BMO concluded that due to the Optionable scheme and other positions that Lee had also mismarked, Lee's trading book was overvalued by an aggregate total of $680 million (Canadian dollars) since the beginning of BMO's fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 2006. The SEC alleges that Cassidy and O'Connor also defrauded Optionable's public shareholders by concealing Optionable's role in the scheme. Optionable's periodic reports touted the synergistic benefits of the derivatives valuation services that Optionable purportedly provided to multiple brokerage clients, but those reports, which Cassidy and O'Connor signed, never disclosed that BMO was the principal client for whom those ""services"" were performed and that the ""valuation services"" provided to BMO were a sham designed to defraud BMO. The SEC further alleges that Cassidy and O'Connor defrauded the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) by selling more than $10 million of their own Optionable stock to NYMEX in April 2007. Both Cassidy and O'Connor represented to NYMEX that Optionable's periodic reports were materially accurate, but they never disclosed anything about their scheme with Lee to defraud the shareholders of BMO, Optionable's largest customer. On May 9, 2007, one day after BMO announced that it had placed Lee on leave and suspended its business relationship with Optionable, Optionable issued an announcement stating that the suspension would have an adverse effect on Optionable's business. Optionable's stock price fell almost 40 percent that day, from $4.64 to $2.81 per share, and dropped to below 50 cents per share one week later after Cassidy's prior criminal record was disclosed in press reports. All four defendants are charged in the Commission's complaint with committing and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, as well as various corporate reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Cassidy and O'Connor also are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. As to each defendant, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The complaint also seeks an order barring Cassidy and O'Connor from acting as officers or directors of a public company. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO), the New York County District Attorney's Office (NYCDA), and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed parallel criminal and regulatory charges today arising from the same conduct that is alleged in the Commission's complaint. Lee pled guilty to parallel criminal charges filed by the USAO and the NYCDA. In connection with his guilty plea, Lee agreed to pay a total of $4.41 million in forfeiture. Lee has agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission's claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Lee, and all of its claims against the other three defendants, remain pending. The Commission's investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the USAO, NYCDA, CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The SEC also is seeking an emergency court order to freeze Dreier's assets and appoint a temporary receiver. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that since at least October 2008, Dreier has been marketing fake promissory notes, including bogus notes of a New York-based real estate development company, to hedge funds and other private investment funds, and has closed at least three sales. According to the complaint, Dreier created an elaborate charade designed to convince purchasers that the notes were genuine. He allegedly distributed phony financial statements and audit opinion letters of a reputable accounting firm, and recruited confederates to play the parts of representatives of legitimate companies involved in the transactions, even creating dummy e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. ""Our complaint alleges a stunning, brazen fraud that targeted some very sophisticated institutional investors. Investors big and small alike should take heed, especially in these difficult economic times, that con artists are out there and may go to elaborate lengths to commit fraud,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. James Clarkson, Acting Regional Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""The conduct alleged here is particularly troubling because it was allegedly committed by an attorney and is contrary to the high standards of character and integrity we expect, and have a right to expect, from members of the bar."" According to the SEC's complaint, Dreier directed that two purchasers of the bogus notes wire payment to what appeared to be his law firm's escrow account. At least one note purchaser discovered the fraud, and demanded and received the return of its investment. Approximately $100 million in known proceeds from the sale of the bogus notes remains unaccounted for. The SEC's complaint alleges that, among other fake securities, Dreier has been offering fictitious promissory notes of a New York-based real estate development company (the developer), a former client of both Dreier and his law firm. Since at least October of this year, Dreier has approached at least three different investment funds with an offer to sell them, at a deep discount, various short-term, unsecured promissory notes supposedly issued by the developer. Two of the investment funds agreed to purchase the notes (one fund purchased notes in two separate transactions) and forwarded approximately $113 million to an account in the name of ""Dreier LLP Attorney Trust Account"" in payment. A third fund was offered the notes, but declined to participate. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, all of the offers were accompanied by documents that Dreier subsequently admitted he knew were fabricated. Dreier offered the notes for sale even though he knew that the developer had never issued the notes, had not authorized Dreier to market them, and indeed knew nothing of their existence or Dreier's offers or sales. The SEC's complaint further alleges that in marketing the notes, Dreier provided the hedge funds with fabricated documents including a ""form"" note and related agreements, ""audited financial statements,"" and purported audit letters, which bore the forged signature of the developer's auditor, but which were printed on purported stationery of the developer's auditing firm. Dreier did not tell representatives from the hedge funds that the notes were bogus, that the ""audited financial statements"" and audit opinion letters were fabricated, or that the developer had never issued the notes or authorized Dreier to market them, despite Dreier's knowledge of these matters. As alleged in the complaint, Dreier has confessed that: In addition to emergency and interim relief, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Dreier from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Madoff yesterday informed two senior employees that his investment advisory business was a fraud.

453,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an unprecedented settlement with Siemens AG to resolve SEC charges that the Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and consumer products violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by engaging in a systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. The SEC alleges that Siemens paid bribes on such widespread transactions as the design and construction of metro transit lines in Venezuela, power plants in Israel, and refineries in Mexico. Siemens also used bribes to obtain such business as developing mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh, national identity cards in Argentina, and medical devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia. According to the SEC's complaint, Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned more than $1.1 billion in profits on these and several other transactions. Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's charges, and a $450 million fine to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle criminal charges. Siemens also will pay a fine of approximately $569 million to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, to whom the company previously paid an approximately $285 million fine in October 2007. ""Public companies that bribe foreign officials are confronting an increasingly well-coordinated international law enforcement effort,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. ""The SEC has brought a record number of enforcement actions for foreign bribery during the past two years, and heightened international cooperation has been critical to those successful efforts. Seimens paid staggering amounts of money to circumvent the rules and gain business. Now, they will pay for it with the largest settlement in the history of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act since it became law in 1977."" Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""This pattern of bribery by Siemens was unprecedented in scale and geographic reach. The corruption alleged in the SEC's complaint involved more than $1.4 billion in bribes to government officials in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. Our success in bringing the company to justice is a testament to the close, coordinated working relationship among the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, and international law enforcement, particularly the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich."" Cheryl J. Scarboro, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""The day is past when multi-national corporations could regard illicit payments to foreign officials as simply another cost of doing business. The $1.6 billion in combined sanctions that Siemens will pay in the U.S. and Germany should make clear that these corrupt business practices will be rooted out wherever they take place, and the sanctions for them will be severe."" The SEC's complaint alleges that between March 12, 2001, and Sept. 30, 2007, Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed the conduct to flourish. Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for bribery. The authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt payments. Siemens made at least 4,283 payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. In addition, Siemens made approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million, which were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for such illicit purposes as commercial bribery and embezzlement. The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA. The SEC's complaint alleges that despite the company's knowledge of bribery at two of its largest groups â Communications and Power Generation â the tone at the top at Siemens was inconsistent with an effective FCPA compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. In November 2006, Siemens' current management began to implement reforms to the company's internal controls, which substantially reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt payments occurred before Nov. 15, 2006. Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books and records. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Siemens has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include profits factored into Munich's fine; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of four years. Since being approached by SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation. Siemens' massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens' FCPA violations. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Fraud and Public Corruption Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service; the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany; the U.K. Financial Services Authority; and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.

454,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged seven individuals and two companies involved in an insider trading ring, alleging that Matthew Devlin, a former registered representative at Lehman Brothers, Inc. in New York City, traded on and tipped his clients and friends with confidential, nonpublic information about 13 impending corporate transactions. Some of Devlin's clients and friends, three of whom worked in the securities or legal professions, tipped others who also traded in the securities of the companies involved in the transactions. According to the SEC's complaint, Devlin got the inside information from his wife, a partner in the New York City office of an international public relations firm working on the deals. Because the inside information was valuable, some of the traders referred to Devlin and his wife as the ""golden goose."" The SEC's complaint further alleges that Devlin was rewarded with cash and luxury items for providing inside information, including a widescreen TV, a leather jacket, and Porsche driving lessons. The SEC alleges that the illicit trading occurred from at least March 2004 through July 2008, and yielded more than $4.8 million in profits. Related criminal charges by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York were unsealed today against some of the defendants named in the SEC's complaint. ""The Commission is unwavering in its determination to pursue illegal insider trading by securities professionals, lawyers, and others,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Today's enforcement action is another example of the exemplary working relationships among the SEC, criminal authorities, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""As alleged in our complaint, many of the defendants took steps to evade detection. This case demonstrates the SEC's ongoing commitment to pursuing sophisticated insider trading schemes."" The SEC's complaint alleges that although many of the defendants had accounts with Lehman, they often attempted to avoid detection by trading in the securities of the target companies in numerous accounts that were not associated with Lehman or Devlin. To further conceal their illicit trading, at least two of the defendants sold off some of the shares they had purchased based on inside information prior to public announcements of the deals. In addition, Devlin and one of his tippees arranged to buy shares on Devlin's behalf so Devlin could profit from the nonpublic information but evade scrutiny. When this tippee's name appeared on a watch list, Devlin and the tippee agreed that Devlin would stop providing him inside information. The SEC's complaint alleges that, based on the information provided by Devlin, the defendants variously purchased the common stock or options of the following public companies: InVision Technologies, Inc.; Eon Labs, Inc.; Mylan, Inc.; Abgenix, Inc.; Aztar Corporation; Veritas, DGC, Inc.; Mercantile Bankshares Corporation; Alcan, Inc.; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.; Pharmion Corporation; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; Anheuser-Busch, Inc.; and Rohm and Haas Company. At the time that Devlin tipped the other defendants about these companies, each company was confidentially engaged in a significant transaction that involved a merger, tender offer, or stock repurchase. The SEC's complaint, which also charges three relief defendants, contains the following allegations: Devlin tipped Jamil Bouchareb, his friend and client at Lehman, about 12 of the deals. Bouchareb, a Miami Beach, Fla.-based trader, traded in his own accounts and tipped his friends and business partners. He also caused his parents to trade. Bouchareb's tippees include his friend and business partner, Daniel Corbin, who traded in a number of the deals through accounts in the name of his companies, Augustus Management LLC and Corbin Investment Holdings LLC. Corbin, a Miami-based trader, shared some of the profits he made with Bouchareb. Bouchareb and Corbin also shared an interest in a number of accounts that traded in the deals. In turn, Corbin provided the information to his father Lee Corbin, an attorney based in White Plains, N.Y. Lee Corbin traded in his personal accounts in four of the deals and owned an interest in the Corbin Investment Holdings account that Daniel used to trade in the deals. Bouchareb and Corbin introduced Devlin to Lee Corbin, who steered Devlin business from some of his trusts and estates clients. Bouchareb also provided the information to his girlfriend, Maria Checa, who currently resides in Greensboro, N.C. Checa traded in her accounts, Checa International, Inc. and Playmate Capital LLC. Bouchareb shared in some of the profits that Checa made. In total, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Lee Corbin, Maria Checa and Bouchareb's parents reaped illegal profits of more than $4.2 million. Frederick Bowers, a registered representative at Lehman and one of Devlin's work partners, was tipped on at least three of the transactions. Bowers then tipped Thomas Faulhaber, one of Bowers' clients at Lehman. Faulhaber realized profits of approximately $217,000. Faulhaber kicked back cash to Bowers who shared some of it with Devlin. Devlin received at least $10,000. Eric Holzer, Devlin's friend and a tax associate in the New York City office of an international law firm, traded in at least three of the transactions. Holzer reaped profits of $175,000 in his own accounts and two accounts controlled by his father. Holzer gave Devlin cash, some of which came from shares he had his father buy on Devlin's behalf. Jeffrey Glover, another of Devlin's Lehman clients and an investment adviser, traded in at least five of the deals. Glover, who is a resident of Bellaire, Texas, made approximately $189,000 in illicit profits. Devlin, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Bowers, Faulhaber, Holzer, Glover, Corbin Investment Holdings, LLC and Augustus Management, LLC are charged with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

456,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Philadelphia-area investment fund manager and his firm for conducting a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme, and has obtained an emergency court order freezing their assets. According to the SECâs complaint, Joseph S. Forte of Broomall, Pa., fraudulently obtained an estimated $50 million from as many as 80 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in his firm, Joseph Forte, L.P. The SEC alleges that Forte told investors that he would invest the funds in an account that would trade in securities futures contracts, including S&P 500 stock index futures. According to the complaint, despite the impressive and consistent returns he reported to investors, Forte consistently lost money in the limited trading that he did, withdrew millions of dollars in so-called fees for his personal use based on the falsely inflated value of Forte LP, and used investor funds to repay other investors. âAs alleged in our complaint, Forte engaged in lies, deception and rapacious behavior at the expense of innocent investors, many of whom considered themselves his friends and close acquaintances,â said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SECâs Philadelphia Regional Office. âUsing other peopleâs money, Forte promised and reported outrageous returns over more than a 10-year period, and because of his relationships with investors was able to lull them into trusting him with their funds.â Judge Paul S. Diamond, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, issued an order on January 7 granting a preliminary injunction, freezing assets, compelling an accounting, and imposing other emergency relief. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Forte and Forte LP consented to the entry of the order. The SECÂs complaint alleges that Forte has been conducting a Ponzi scheme since at least 1995. Forte, who has never been registered with the SEC in any capacity, has admitted that he misrepresented and falsified Forte LPâs trading performance from the very first quarter. From 1995 through Sept. 30, 2008, Forte and Forte LP reported to investors annual returns ranging from 18.52 percent to as high as 37.96 percent. However, from January 1998 through October 2008, the Forte LP trading account had net trading losses of approximately $3.3 million. The SECâs complaint further alleges that in addition to misrepresenting to investors that the trading was highly successful and making huge profits, Forte and Forte LP misrepresented the use of investor funds. Although Forte claimed that he raised approximately $50 million from investors for the purpose of participating in the trading program, Forte deposited only $25.8 million in the trading account between January 1998 and October 2008, and during that same time period withdrew $23.1 million. Forte claims that he took at least $10 to $12 million in so-called fees for his personal use based on the falsely inflated value of Forte LP. But Forte LP statements provided to investors reflect fees charged of $28.7 million between March 1995 and September 2008. He also claims he used approximately $15 to $20 million of investor funds to repay other investors â the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. The SECâs complaint alleges that Forte and Forte LP also lied to investors about the value of the partnership portfolio. For example, in September 2008, they reported to investors that the Forte LP portfolio had a value of more than $150 million. In fact, Forte LPâs trading account at that time had a balance of only $146,814. The SECâs complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

458,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Arthur Nadel of Sarasota, Fla., with fraud in connection with six hedge funds for which he acted as the principal investment advisor. According to the SECâs complaint, Nadel provided false and misleading information for dissemination to investors about the fundsâ historical returns and falsely overstated the value of investments in the funds by approximately $300 million. According to the SECâs complaint, the funds appear to have total assets of less than $1 million. The complaint also alleges that Nadel recently transferred at least $1.25 million from two of the funds to secret bank accounts that he controlled. Nadel reportedly has been missing since Jan. 14, 2009. The SEC also alleges that two entities with which Nadel was associated, Scoop Capital LLC and Scoop Management, Inc., provided investment advice to all of the funds and also engaged in fraud as a result of Nadelâs actions. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing defendantsâ assets and appointing a receiver. David Nelson, Director of the SECâs Miami Regional Office, said, âInvestors should be able to rely on the truthfulness of an account statement and offering materials. Mr. Nadelâs alleged actions deceived investors, and we are seeking to hold him accountable for that misconduct.â The six hedge funds and two other investment management companies are charged as relief defendants in the SECâs complaint. The SEC alleges that Nadel provided false and misleading information to the relief defendants for dissemination to investors through account statements and through offering memoranda. For example: The SEC filed its emergency action in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeking, among other things, injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. United States District Judge Richard A. Lazzara granted all of the emergency relief requested by the SEC, including a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other relief against Nadel.

460,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. and two of its former investment adviser representatives with securities laws violations for misleading pension consulting clients about its money manager identification process and failing to disclose conflicts of interest when recommending them to use two of the firm's affiliated services. Merrill Lynch has agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a $1 million penalty. ""There has been tremendous growth in the pension consulting business in recent years. This case is an important reminder to firms and their investment adviser representatives that, whenever they sit across the table from their advisory clients, they need to make sure that all material conflicts of interest are disclosed,"" said Scott W. Friestad, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. According to the SEC's order, Merrill Lynch failed to disclose its conflicts of interest when recommending that clients use directed brokerage to pay hard dollar fees, whereby the clients directed their money managers to execute trades through Merrill Lynch. These clients received credit for a portion of the commissions generated by these trades against the hard dollar fee owed for the advisory services provided by Merrill Lynch Consulting Services. Consequently, Merrill Lynch and its investment adviser representatives could and often did receive significantly higher revenue if clients chose to use Merrill Lynch directed brokerage services. The SEC's order finds that Merrill Lynch also failed to disclose a similar conflict of interest in recommending that clients use Merrill Lynch's transition management desk. In addition, the SEC finds that Merrill Lynch made misleading statements to the clients served by its Ponte Vedra South, Fla. office regarding the process used to identify new money managers to present to its clients. The SEC also charged Michael Callaway and Jeffrey Swanson, who were formerly employed in Merrill Lynch's Ponte Vedra South office. In a settled enforcement action against Swanson, the SEC finds that he made misleading statements to some of the firm's pension consulting clients regarding the process by which Merrill Lynch assisted them in identifying new managers. As a result, the SEC charged Swanson with aiding and abetting and causing Merrill Lynch's violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Swanson has agreed to a censure, and to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. In the contested enforcement action against Callaway, the SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that Callaway breached his fiduciary duty in making misrepresentations about the manager identification process used by the Ponte Vedra South office and his compensation in connection with transition management services. The Division of Enforcement further alleges that Callaway was a cause of Merrill Lynch's violation of the Advisers Act because he failed to ensure that Merrill Lynch disclosed to clients the conflicts of interest in recommending that clients enter into a directed brokerage relationship with Merrill Lynch and in recommending that they use Merrill Lynch for transition management services. The Division of Enforcement charges that, by this conduct, Callaway willfully aided and abetted and caused Merrill Lynch's violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The SEC charged Merrill Lynch with violations of an anti-fraud provision of the Advisers Act, which does not require a showing of scienter. The SEC also charged Merrill Lynch with failing to maintain certain records and failing to supervise its investment adviser representatives in the Ponte Vedra South office. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Merrill Lynch has agreed to a censure, to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 204 and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and to pay a $1 million penalty.

461,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged seven individuals involved in an insider trading ring that generated more than $11.6 million in illegal profits and avoided losses. The SEC alleges that two mergers and acquisitions professionals, Nicos Achilleas Stephanou at UBS Investment Bank and Ramesh Chakrapani at Blackstone Advisory Services, L.P., tipped five individuals including Joseph Contorinis, a portfolio manager for a Jefferies Group, Inc. hedge fund, with material nonpublic information about three impending corporate acquisitions. ""The Commission and the public expect Wall Street professionals to act with the highest degree of ethics and integrity. It is unconscionable when these highly paid individuals abuse their access to sensitive information and enrich themselves at the expense of others,"" said Scott W. Friestad, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""As today's actions demonstrate, we are aggressively working to combat insider trading wherever it occurs and whoever is involved."" Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, said, ""These enforcement actions are the direct result of innovative investigative techniques that the SEC is using to identify patterns of unlawful trading and suspicious relationships among traders who, in this case, live around the world. Market professionals who may have engaged in insider trading, or may be tempted to, cannot rest comfortably in the belief that their wrongdoing will go undetected. We will continue to follow leads wherever necessary to unwind intricate schemes and will seek all available remedies against those who engage in unlawful conduct."" According to the SEC's complaint, the insider trading ring included: Related criminal charges by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York were unsealed today against Koulouroudis, Contorinis, Nicos Achilleas Stephanou, and George Paparrizos. The SEC's complaint alleges that the illicit trading occurred from at least November 2005 through December 2006 and involved at least the following acquisitions: On Monday, Jan. 23, 2006, prior to the opening of trading, ABS issued a press release announcing the acquisition of ABS by a consortium of buyers at $26.29 per share. Nicos Stephanou had access to material nonpublic information concerning the acquisition of ABS prior to its public release because one of the companies that eventually acquired ABS retained UBS as its financial advisor and Stephanou was a member of the team at UBS that advised the company on the acquisition. Nicos Stephanou tipped George Paparrizos, Michael Koulouroudis and Joseph Contorinis with material nonpublic information about the ABS acquisition, all of whom traded on the basis of that information. Nicos Stephanou also either tipped his father, Achilleas Stephanou, or in an effort to evade detection, Stephanou traded ABS securities in his father's brokerage account. In addition, Nicos Stephanou either tipped Konstantinos Paparrizos or, in an effort to evade detection, George Paparrizos traded ABS securities in his father's account. In particular, after receiving the nonpublic information from Nicos Stephanou, Joseph Contorinis caused the Jefferies Paragon Fund to purchase over 2.6 million shares of ABS at a cost of $59 million. By virtue of their trading in ABS securities, the defendants made total profits and avoided losses of approximately $7.7 million. On Dec. 18, 2006, prior to the market open, ELK publicly announced that it had agreed to be acquired by The Carlyle Group for $38.00 per share. ELK hired UBS as its financial advisor. Through working on the deal himself, through communications with other employees at UBS who advised ELK on the acquisition, and/or by virtue of his access to UBS' internal files, Nicos Stephanou had access to material nonpublic information regarding ELK's impending acquisition. Nicos Stephanou tipped George Paparrizos and Michael Koulouroudis with material nonpublic information about the ELK acquisition. George Paparrizos and Michael Koulouroudis traded on the basis of that information. Nicos Stephanou also either tipped his father, Achilleas Stephanou or, in an effort to evade detection, traded ABS in his father's brokerage account. In addition, Nicos Stephanou either tipped Konstantinos Paparrizos or, in an effort to avoid detection, George Paparrizos traded ELK securities his in father's account. By virtue of this trading in ELK securities, Achilleas Stephanou, George Paparrizos, Konstantinos Paparrizos and Michael Koulouroudis and his family members made total profits of approximately $300,000. On Oct. 10, 2006, NHI publicly announced that its Board of Directors had formed a Special Committee of independent directors, and had retained Blackstone as its financial advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. NHI also announced that it had received a buyout offer from its CEO offering $30.00 per share in cash, but stated that the offer was inadequate. Chakrapani had access to material nonpublic information concerning a potential acquisition of NHI as a result of his employment at Blackstone. Chakrapani was a member of the team at Blackstone that advised NHI on its potential acquisition. Chakrapani tipped Nicos Stephanou with material nonpublic information regarding the potential NHI acquisition, who in turn tipped Koulouroudis with that information. Koulouroudis traded on the basis of this information. Nicos Stephanou also either tipped his father, or in an effort to evade detection, traded NHI in his father's brokerage account. By virtue of this trading in NHI securities, Achilleas Stephanou and Koulouroudis and his family members made total profits of $17,000. Nicos Stephanou, Achilleas Stephanou, George Paparrizos, Konstantinos Paparrizos and Koulouroudis are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Chakrapani and Contorinis are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits and losses avoided with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. On Jan. 13, 2009, the SEC filed a related complaint against Chakrapani alleging, among other things, that he tipped another friend, also an industry professional, with material nonpublic information about the ABS acquisition he learned as a result of his employment. The friend, identified in the complaint as Tippee 1, then traded in his personal account, was responsible for and/or caused trades on behalf of two proprietary trading accounts affiliated with his employer, and tipped or traded on behalf of his parents. The tippees generated a total of approximately $3.6 million in illegal profits. See SEC v. Chakrapani, 09 CV 325 (S.D.N.Y.).

462,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settlements with KBR, Inc. and Halliburton Co. to resolve SEC charges that KBR subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root LLC bribed Nigerian government officials over a 10-year period, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), in order to obtain construction contracts. The SEC also charged that KBR and Halliburton, KBR's former parent company, engaged in books and records violations and internal controls violations related to the bribery. KBR and Halliburton have agreed to pay $177 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's charges. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has agreed to pay a $402 million fine to settle parallel criminal charges brought today by the U.S. Department of Justice. The sanctions represent the largest combined settlement ever paid by U.S. companies since the FCPA's inception. ""FCPA violations have been and will continue to be dealt with severely by the SEC and other law enforcement agencies,"" said SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro. ""Any company that seeks to put greed ahead of the law by making illegal payments to win business should beware that we are working vigorously across borders to detect and punish such illicit conduct."" Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""This case demonstrates the close and cooperative working relationships that have developed in FCPA investigations among the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, and foreign law enforcement agencies and securities regulators."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""The SEC will not tolerate violations of the FCPA, regardless of the lengths to which public companies will go to structure their corrupt transactions to avoid detection. Multi-national companies should take heed that attempting to conceal bribes by funneling them through intermediaries or offshore entities will not be successful."" Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice said, ""Today's guilty plea by KBR ends one chapter in the Department's long-running investigation of corruption in the award of $6 billion in construction contracts in Nigeria. This bribery scheme involved both senior foreign government officials and KBR corporate executives who took actions to insulate themselves from the reach of U.S. law enforcement. The successful prosecution of KBR, and its agreement to pay a more than $400 million fine, demonstrates that no one is above the law, and that the Department is determined to seek penalties that are commensurate with, and will deter, this kind of serious criminal misconduct."" Kellogg Brown & Root LLC's predecessor entities (Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc. and The M.W. Kellogg Company) were members of a four-company joint venture that won the construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. In September 1998, Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries, Inc., the parent company of The M.W. Kellogg Company. The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, members of the joint venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to officials within the Nigerian government in order to obtain the construction contracts. The former CEO of the predecessor entities, Albert ""Jack"" Stanley, and others involved in the joint venture met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe payments. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham contracts with two agents, one based in the United Kingdom and one based in Japan, to funnel money to Nigerian officials. The SEC's complaint alleges that the internal controls of Halliburton, the parent company of the KBR predecessor entities from 1998 to 2006, failed to detect or prevent the bribery, and that Halliburton records were falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. In September 2008, Stanley pleaded guilty to bribery and related charges and entered into a settlement with the SEC. The SEC alleges that officials of the joint venture formed a ""cultural committee"" to decide how to carry out the bribery scheme. The committee decided to use the United Kingdom agent to make payments to high-ranking Nigerian officials and to use the Japanese agent to make payments to lower-ranking Nigerian officials. As the joint venture was paid for work on the construction project, the joint venture in turn made payments to the Japanese agent and to the Swiss and Monaco bank accounts of the United Kingdom agent. The total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million. After receiving the money, the United Kingdom agent made substantial payments to accounts controlled by Nigerian government officials, and beginning in 2002 paid $5 million in cash to a Nigerian political party. The SEC's complaint further alleges that, after the Dresser acquisition, Halliburton failed to devise and maintain adequate internal controls to govern the use of foreign sales agents and failed to maintain and enforce the internal controls it had. Halliburton's due diligence investigation of the United Kingdom agent failed to detect or prevent the bribery scheme. Halliburton conducted no due diligence on the Japanese agent. As a result of the scheme, numerous Halliburton records contained false information relating to the payments to the agents. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, KBR and Halliburton have consented to the entry of a court order that (i) permanently enjoins KBR from violating the anti-bribery and records falsification provisions in Sections 30A, 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from aiding and abetting violations of the record-keeping and internal control provisions in Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; (ii) permanently enjoins Halliburton from violating the record-keeping and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act; (iii) orders the companies to disgorge $177 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme; (iv) imposes an independent monitor for KBR for a period of three years to review its FCPA compliance program, and (v) imposes an independent consultant for Halliburton to review its policies and procedures as they relate to compliance with the FCPA. The proposed settlements are subject to the court's approval. In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal action against Kellogg Brown & Root LLC, charging one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and four counts of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has pled guilty to each of these counts. Under its plea agreement, Kellogg Brown & Root LLC is required to pay a criminal fine of $402 million and to retain a monitor to review and evaluate KBR's policies and procedures as they relate to compliance with the FCPA.

463,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Limited (RIM) and four of its senior executives for stock option backdating. The SEC's complaint alleges that Ontario, Canada-based RIM, its former Chief Financial Officer Dennis Kavelman, former Vice President of Finance Angelo Loberto, and Co-Chief Executive Officers James Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis illegally granted undisclosed, in-the-money options to RIM executives and employees by backdating millions of stock options over an eight-year period from 1998 through 2006. ""As alleged in our complaint, RIM and its highest level executives engaged in widespread backdating of options which provided them and other employees with millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This enforcement action underscores the SEC's resolve to assure full and accurate disclosure to U.S. investors by foreign issuers."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Companies and executives who attempt to conceal their fraudulent conduct from investors and regulators will be held accountable."" The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading disclosures about how RIM priced and accounted for options. In addition, according to the complaint, the backdating violated the terms of RIM's stock option plan and a listing requirement of the Toronto Stock Exchange. RIM's stock is listed on both the NASDAQ Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Specifically, the SEC's complaint alleges that Kavelman, Loberto, Balsillie and Lazaridis backdated option agreements and offer letters, which concealed the fact that the options were granted in-the-money. The complaint also alleges that Kavelman and Loberto took steps to hide the backdating from regulators, RIM's independent auditor and outside lawyer. For instance, Kavelman and Loberto usually picked low strike prices within reporting periods and in some instances avoided the lowest price so regulators would not detect the backdating. On one occasion, Kavelman asked a manager not to document improper pricing in e-mails. Kavelman wrote, ""FYI, it is a major breach of protocol to be discussing (and documenting via email) using option pricing other than that allowable by the Ontario Securities Commission and the SEC in the US."" The complaint further alleges that after all four executives were aware of backdating issues that had come to light at other companies, they attended RIM's July 2006 annual shareholder meeting where Kavelman misled investors by denying that RIM was backdating options. All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, on the following terms: RIM consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement with RIM takes into account RIM's cooperation during the SEC's investigation. Kavelman and Loberto consented to an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud, internal controls, books and records and misrepresentation to auditors provisions and from aiding and abetting RIM's violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Kavelman also consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the certification provision of the federal securities laws. Kavelman and Loberto agreed to be barred for a period of five years from serving as officers or directors of any issuer that has a class of securities registered with the SEC or that is required to file reports with the SEC. In addition, Kavelman and Loberto agreed to resolve an anticipated administrative proceeding by consenting to an SEC order prohibiting them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as accountants for five years. Balsillie and Lazaridis consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating certain antifraud provisions (specifically Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933), and the internal controls and books and records provisions and from aiding and abetting RIM's violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The individual defendants will pay penalties in the following amounts: $500,000 for Kavelman; $425,000 for Loberto; $350,000 for Balsillie; and $150,000 for Lazaridis. The individual defendants also agreed to disgorge the in-the-money value of backdated options they had exercised ($132,914.60 for Kavelman, $47,950.56 for Loberto, $334,250 for Balsillie and $328,300 for Lazaridis) plus interest. Their disgorgement will be deemed satisfied by their previous payment of these amounts to RIM. The settlements in the civil injunctive action are subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On Feb. 5, 2009, the Ontario Securities Commission brought a related settled action against RIM, Balsillie, Lazaridis, Kavelman, Loberto and certain other directors which included the total payment in Canadian dollars of $76.85 million and other sanctions.

464,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robert Allen Stanford and three of his companies for orchestrating a fraudulent, multi-billion dollar investment scheme centering on an $8 billion CD program. Stanford's companies include Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank (SIB), Houston-based broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company (SGC), and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. The SEC also charged SIB chief financial officer James Davis as well as Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group (SFG), in the enforcement action. Pursuant to the SEC's request for emergency relief for the benefit of defrauded investors, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order, froze the defendants' assets, and appointed a receiver to marshal those assets. ""As we allege in our complaint, Stanford and the close circle of family and friends with whom he runs his businesses perpetrated a massive fraud based on false promises and fabricated historical return data to prey on investors,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We are moving quickly and decisively in this enforcement action to stop this fraudulent conduct and preserve assets for investors."" Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ""We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world."" The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that acting through a network of SGC financial advisers, SIB has sold approximately $8 billion of so-called ""certificates of deposit"" to investors by promising improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates. These rates were supposedly earned through SIB's unique investment strategy, which purportedly allowed the bank to achieve double-digit returns on its investments for the past 15 years. According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants have misrepresented to CD purchasers that their deposits are safe, falsely claiming that the bank re-invests client funds primarily in ""liquid"" financial instruments (the portfolio); monitors the portfolio through a team of 20-plus analysts; and is subject to yearly audits by Antiguan regulators. Recently, as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, SIB attempted to calm its own investors by falsely claiming the bank has no ""direct or indirect"" exposure to the Madoff scheme. According to the SEC's complaint, SIB is operated by a close circle of Stanford's family and friends. SIB's investment committee, responsible for the management of the bank's multi-billion dollar portfolio of assets, is comprised of Stanford; Stanford's father who resides in Mexia, Texas; another Mexia resident with business experience in cattle ranching and car sales; Pendergest-Holt, who prior to joining SFG had no financial services or securities industry experience; and Davis, who was Stanford's college roommate. The SEC's complaint also alleges an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales by SGC advisers of a proprietary mutual fund wrap program, called Stanford Allocation Strategy (SAS), by using materially false historical performance data. According to the complaint, the false data helped SGC grow the SAS program from less than $10 million in 2004 to more than $1 billion, generating fees for SGC (and ultimately Stanford) of approximately $25 million in 2007 and 2008. The fraudulent SAS performance was used to recruit registered investment advisers with significant books of business, who were then heavily incentivized to reallocate their clients' assets to SIB's CD program. The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act, and registration provisions of the Investment Company Act. In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in connection with this matter.

465,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robert Allen Stanford and three of his companies for orchestrating a fraudulent, multi-billion dollar investment scheme centering on an $8 billion CD program. Stanford's companies include Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank (SIB), Houston-based broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company (SGC), and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. The SEC also charged SIB chief financial officer James Davis as well as Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group (SFG), in the enforcement action. Pursuant to the SEC's request for emergency relief for the benefit of defrauded investors, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order, froze the defendants' assets, and appointed a receiver to marshal those assets. ""As we allege in our complaint, Stanford and the close circle of family and friends with whom he runs his businesses perpetrated a massive fraud based on false promises and fabricated historical return data to prey on investors,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We are moving quickly and decisively in this enforcement action to stop this fraudulent conduct and preserve assets for investors."" Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ""We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world."" The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that acting through a network of SGC financial advisers, SIB has sold approximately $8 billion of so-called ""certificates of deposit"" to investors by promising improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates. These rates were supposedly earned through SIB's unique investment strategy, which purportedly allowed the bank to achieve double-digit returns on its investments for the past 15 years. According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants have misrepresented to CD purchasers that their deposits are safe, falsely claiming that the bank re-invests client funds primarily in ""liquid"" financial instruments (the portfolio); monitors the portfolio through a team of 20-plus analysts; and is subject to yearly audits by Antiguan regulators. Recently, as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, SIB attempted to calm its own investors by falsely claiming the bank has no ""direct or indirect"" exposure to the Madoff scheme. According to the SEC's complaint, SIB is operated by a close circle of Stanford's family and friends. SIB's investment committee, responsible for the management of the bank's multi-billion dollar portfolio of assets, is comprised of Stanford; Stanford's father who resides in Mexia, Texas; another Mexia resident with business experience in cattle ranching and car sales; Pendergest-Holt, who prior to joining SFG had no financial services or securities industry experience; and Davis, who was Stanford's college roommate. The SEC's complaint also alleges an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales by SGC advisers of a proprietary mutual fund wrap program, called Stanford Allocation Strategy (SAS), by using materially false historical performance data. According to the complaint, the false data helped SGC grow the SAS program from less than $10 million in 2004 to more than $1 billion, generating fees for SGC (and ultimately Stanford) of approximately $25 million in 2007 and 2008. The fraudulent SAS performance was used to recruit registered investment advisers with significant books of business, who were then heavily incentivized to reallocate their clients' assets to SIB's CD program. The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act, and registration provisions of the Investment Company Act. In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in connection with this matter.

473,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robert Allen Stanford and three of his companies for orchestrating a fraudulent, multi-billion dollar investment scheme centering on an $8 billion CD program. Stanford's companies include Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank (SIB), Houston-based broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company (SGC), and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. The SEC also charged SIB chief financial officer James Davis as well as Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group (SFG), in the enforcement action. Pursuant to the SEC's request for emergency relief for the benefit of defrauded investors, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order, froze the defendants' assets, and appointed a receiver to marshal those assets. ""As we allege in our complaint, Stanford and the close circle of family and friends with whom he runs his businesses perpetrated a massive fraud based on false promises and fabricated historical return data to prey on investors,"" said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We are moving quickly and decisively in this enforcement action to stop this fraudulent conduct and preserve assets for investors."" Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ""We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world."" The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that acting through a network of SGC financial advisers, SIB has sold approximately $8 billion of so-called ""certificates of deposit"" to investors by promising improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates. These rates were supposedly earned through SIB's unique investment strategy, which purportedly allowed the bank to achieve double-digit returns on its investments for the past 15 years. According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants have misrepresented to CD purchasers that their deposits are safe, falsely claiming that the bank re-invests client funds primarily in ""liquid"" financial instruments (the portfolio); monitors the portfolio through a team of 20-plus analysts; and is subject to yearly audits by Antiguan regulators. Recently, as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, SIB attempted to calm its own investors by falsely claiming the bank has no ""direct or indirect"" exposure to the Madoff scheme. According to the SEC's complaint, SIB is operated by a close circle of Stanford's family and friends. SIB's investment committee, responsible for the management of the bank's multi-billion dollar portfolio of assets, is comprised of Stanford; Stanford's father who resides in Mexia, Texas; another Mexia resident with business experience in cattle ranching and car sales; Pendergest-Holt, who prior to joining SFG had no financial services or securities industry experience; and Davis, who was Stanford's college roommate. The SEC's complaint also alleges an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales by SGC advisers of a proprietary mutual fund wrap program, called Stanford Allocation Strategy (SAS), by using materially false historical performance data. According to the complaint, the false data helped SGC grow the SAS program from less than $10 million in 2004 to more than $1 billion, generating fees for SGC (and ultimately Stanford) of approximately $25 million in 2007 and 2008. The fraudulent SAS performance was used to recruit registered investment advisers with significant books of business, who were then heavily incentivized to reallocate their clients' assets to SIB's CD program. The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act, and registration provisions of the Investment Company Act. In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in connection with this matter. FINRA independently developed information through its examination and investigative processes that contributed significantly to the filing of this enforcement action. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

485,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Mark Bloom and his firm North Hills Management LLC with securities fraud, and obtained an emergency court order to freeze their assets and halt an alleged investment scheme involving the marketing of a ""fund of funds"" investment vehicle. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Bloom, through North Hills, raised approximately $30 million from 40 to 50 investors between 2001 and 2007 by representing that the assets would be invested in a diverse group of hedge funds. Instead, Bloom misappropriated more than $13.2 million of investor funds to furnish a lavish lifestyle that included the purchase of luxury homes, cars and boats for himself and his wife, who is named as a relief defendant. The remaining funds were invested in a single fund which itself turned out to be fraudulent. Scott Friestad, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""We allege a blatant investment scheme, and today's action shows that the Commission will act decisively to preserve assets for investors."" James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""As today's emergency action demonstrates, the SEC will bring aggressive enforcement action against individuals who defraud innocent investors."" The SEC alleges that the defendants solicited investments in North Hills, L.P. (the ""Fund""), which is named as a relief defendant, by making misleading representations. Bloom and North Hills represented that the Fund's assets would be allocated across multiple funds and fund managers to ensure diversification and moderate risk. They sent investors false monthly account statements that portrayed their investments as profitable when, in reality, Bloom was systematically looting the Fund's trading account by making ""loans"" to himself and by investing in contravention of the Fund's stated investment strategy in an investment known as the Philadelphia Alternative Asset Fund (PAAF). Bloom received undisclosed commissions from PAAF in excess of $355,000 over a 16-month period. PAAF itself was uncovered as a fraudulent scheme in June 2005. According to the SEC's complaint, beginning in November 2007, one of the Fund's largest investors, a charitable trust (the ""Trust"") that funds children's schools began to serve Bloom with redemption requests, which Bloom repeatedly evaded. To date, Bloom has failed to honor the Trust's redemption requests in full and claims that he does not have the means to do so. The Trust is owed more than $9.5 million on its investment. The SEC complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Judge John G. Koeltl of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants, freezing their assets, ordering accountings, and approving the appointment of a receiver. The SEC's complaint also seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Southern District of New York announced parallel criminal charges against Bloom earlier today, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed related charges against Bloom and North Hills.

486,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Pearl River, N.Y., investment management firm and its principal for operating a large-scale scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors of millions of dollars by providing them with misleading marketing materials that significantly overstated investment returns and by misrepresenting the value of the assets under management. The SEC is seeking a court order to freeze the assets of Westgate Capital Management LLC and its managing member James M. Nicholson. The SEC alleges that they solicited investors with false claims of an almost unbroken eight-year string of monthly investment successes. Neither the firm nor its principal is registered with the SEC.

According to the SECâs complaint, at least one Westgate fund claimed positive returns in 98 of 99 consecutive months. The SEC alleges Nicholson sought to further his fraud by creating a fictitious accounting firm and providing some of his investors with bogus audited financial statements. Nicholson apparently concocted this imposter firm under the name of an actual accountant while using his own telephone number and driverâs license to set up a âvirtual office.â According to the SECâs complaint, by late 2008, the funds had sustained such losses that Nicholson and Westgate could no longer honor redemption requests. They hid the losses from investors with misrepresentations and false sales brochures. Nicholson further attempted to hide losses in the Westgate fund family by other devices. He closed one fund that was heavily invested in the bankrupt Lehman Brothers and folded its assets into another Westgate fund. He issued bad checks to some investors seeking to cash out, and ultimately suspended all investor redemptions due to what he called investorsâ âirrational behavior.â The SEC alleges that Westgate and Nicholson have violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC is seeking an emergency court order freezing the assets of Nicholson, Westgate, and the hedge funds; preventing the destruction of documents; granting expedited discovery; and requiring Nicholson and Westgate to provide accountings. Additionally, the SEC seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and financial penalties against both defendants.

488,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today took emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against two New York residents and their three affiliated entities, who orchestrated a brazen investment fraud involving the misappropriation of as much as $554 million in investor assets. The SEC alleges that Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh promised investors that their money would be invested in a stock index arbitrage strategy. Instead, Greenwood and Walsh essentially treated their clients' investments as their personal piggy bank to purchase multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm and horses, luxury cars, and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Greenwood and Walsh as well as their companies: WG Trading Investors, L.P. (WGTI), which is an unregistered investment vehicle; WG Trading Company, Limited Partnership (WGTC), which is a registered broker-dealer located in Greenwich, Conn.; and Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (Westridge), which is a registered investment adviser located in Santa Barbara, Calif. Scott Friestad, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Today's emergency action shows that the Commission will act decisively to put a stop to ongoing fraudulent investment schemes and preserve assets for investors."" James Clarkson, Acting Regional Director of the New York Regional Office, added, ""As today's emergency action demonstrates, individuals who defraud innocent investors, such as the educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans harmed in this case, should expect to be confronted with swift and aggressive enforcement action from the SEC."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Greenwood and Walsh have been orchestrating the fraudulent investment scheme through their affiliated entities since at least 1996. The SEC alleges that they solicited a number of institutional investors, including educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans, by promising to invest their money in an ""enhanced equity index"" strategy that involves purchasing and selling equity index futures and engaging in equity index arbitrage trading. However, Greenwood and Walsh have been misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds for their personal use instead of investing the money in the enhanced equity index strategy. In fact, Greenwood and Walsh misappropriated as much as $554 million of the $667 million that Westridge clients invested in WGTI. Greenwood and Walsh have provided some of the investors' money to their spouse and ex-spouse, respectively, who are also named as relief defendants in the SEC's complaint. The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Judge George B. Daniels of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering accountings and approving the appointment of a receiver over WGTI, WGTC and Westridge. The SEC's complaint also seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.

489,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today took emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against two New York residents and their three affiliated entities, who orchestrated a brazen investment fraud involving the misappropriation of as much as $554 million in investor assets. The SEC alleges that Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh promised investors that their money would be invested in a stock index arbitrage strategy. Instead, Greenwood and Walsh essentially treated their clients' investments as their personal piggy bank to purchase multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm and horses, luxury cars, and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Greenwood and Walsh as well as their companies: WG Trading Investors, L.P.

The SEC alleges that they solicited a number of institutional investors, including educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans, by promising to invest their money in an ""enhanced equity index"" strategy that involves purchasing and selling equity index futures and engaging in equity index arbitrage trading. However, Greenwood and Walsh have been misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds for their personal use instead of investing the money in the enhanced equity index strategy. In fact, Greenwood and Walsh misappropriated as much as $554 million of the $667 million that Westridge clients invested in WGTI. Greenwood and Walsh have provided some of the investors' money to their spouse and ex-spouse, respectively, who are also named as relief defendants in the SEC's complaint.

491,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a money manager with offices in New York and Rhode Island for falsely creating a billion-dollar client in order to gain credibility and attract legitimate investors. In its complaint, the SEC charged Leila Jenkins and her firm, Locke Capital Management Inc., with making up the supposedly massive client and then repeatedly lying about its existence to land real clients. The SEC alleges that Jenkins lied to the SEC staff about the existence of the invented client and furnished the SEC staff with bogus documents in 2008, including fake account statements that she created. ""Today's enforcement action demonstrates that investment advisers who lure clients with false claims will be held accountable for their actions,"" said George Curtis, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""In this case, the conduct was particularly egregious because Jenkins lied to the SEC staff to try to escape detection."" The SEC's complaint alleges that Jenkins made up so-called ""confidential"" client accounts, purportedly based in Switzerland, and repeatedly claimed the accounts contained more than $1 billion in assets that she managed. From at least 2003 to 2009, falsehoods concerning the confidential accounts were communicated in brochures, meetings, submissions to online databases that prospective clients used to select money managers, and in SEC filings. Even as Locke began to take on clients in late 2006, the assets under management of its real clients never amounted to more than a very small portion of the billion-plus dollars that Jenkins claimed to manage. ""This brazen web of lies to investors constituted a serious breach of fiduciary duty,"" said David Bergers, Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. Besides the invented client and assets under management, the SEC's complaint alleges several other lies Jenkins and her firm told to investors. These include misrepresenting Locke's performance for years in which Locke had no clients and deceiving clients about the makeup of the firm, including the number, identity, and role of its employees. According to the SEC's complaint, Jenkins maintains residences in Newport, R.I., and Palm Beach, Fla. In its enforcement action, the Commission alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 204, 204A, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a), 204A-1, and 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder, and is seeking a monetary penalty, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws.

492,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the auditors of Bernard Madoff's broker-dealer firm with committing securities fraud by representing that they had conducted legitimate audits, when in fact they had not. In its complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that from 1991 through 2008, certified public accountant David G. Friehling and his firm, Friehling & Horowitz, CPAs, P.C. (F&H), purported to audit financial statements and disclosures of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS). The SEC previously charged Madoff and BMIS with committing securities fraud through a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of his firm. ""As the new Chairman, I will ensure that we continue this investigation and hold accountable all those who helped to facilitate this massive fraud,"" said SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro, who took office in January. James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said, ""As we allege in our complaint, Friehling's and F&H's misconduct is egregious. Friehling essentially sold his license to Madoff for more than 17 years while Madoff's Ponzi scheme went undetected. For all those years, Friehling deceived investors and regulators by declaring that Madoff's enterprise had a clean audit record."" The SEC's complaint alleges that Friehling enabled Madoff's Ponzi scheme by falsely stating, in annual audit reports, that F&H audited BMIS financial statements pursuant to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), including the requirements to maintain auditor independence and perform audit procedures regarding custody of securities. F&H also made representations that BMIS financial statements were presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and that Friehling reviewed internal controls at BMIS, including controls over the custody of assets, and found no material inadequacies. According to the SEC's complaint, Friehling knew that BMIS regularly distributed the annual audit reports to Madoff customers and that the reports were filed with the SEC and other regulators. The SEC's complaint alleges that all of these statements were materially false because Friehling and F&H did not perform a meaningful audit of BMIS, and did not perform procedures to confirm that the securities BMIS purportedly held on behalf of its customers even existed. Instead, the SEC alleges that Friehling merely pretended to conduct minimal audit procedures of certain accounts to make it seem like he was conducting an audit, and then failed to document his purported findings and conclusions as required under GAAS. If properly stated, those financial statements, along with BMIS related disclosures regarding reserve requirements, would have shown that BMIS owed tens of billions of dollars in additional liabilities to its customers and was therefore insolvent. According to the SEC's complaint, Friehling similarly did not conduct any audit procedures with respect to BMIS internal controls, and had no basis to represent that BMIS had no material inadequacies. Afraid that his work for BMIS would be subject to peer review, as required of accountants who conduct audits, Friehling lied to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for years and denied that he conducted any audit work. The SEC further alleges that Friehling and F&H obtained ill-gotten gains through compensation from Madoff and BMIS, and also from withdrawing returns from accounts held at BMIS in the name of Friehling and his family members. The SEC's complaint specifically alleges that Friehling and F&H violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-3 thereunder, and Section 17 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring both Friehling and F&H to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.

493,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York's former Deputy Comptroller and a top political advisor for extracting millions of dollars in kickbacks from investment management firms seeking to manage the assets of New York's largest pension fund. The SEC's complaint alleges that Henry ""Hank"" Morris, the top political advisor and chief fundraiser for former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, and David Loglisci, former Deputy Comptroller and Chief Investment Officer of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme from 2003 through late 2006 that corrupted the integrity of the New York State Common Retirement Fund in order to enrich Morris as well as others with close ties to Morris and Loglisci. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Loglisci caused the fund to invest billions of dollars with private equity firms and hedge fund managers who together paid millions of dollars in the form of sham ""finder"" or ""placement agent"" fees to obtain investments from the fund. As asserted in the SEC's complaint, Morris made more than $15 million in such purported placement and finder fees. ""Investments should be based on sound decisions not shady deals,"" said SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. ""We will continue this investigation and will pursue anyone who unlawfully profited from their privileged access to the hard-earned contributions of public employees."" James Clarkson, Acting Regional Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said, ""Kickback schemes corrupt the integrity of the investment decision-making processes. These defendants enriched themselves and their associates at the expense of the fund."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the payments to Morris and others were kickbacks that resulted from quid pro quo arrangements or that were otherwise fraudulently induced by the defendants. As laid out in the complaint, Loglisci ensured that investment managers who made the requisite payments to Morris â and other recipients designated by Morris and Loglisci â were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied fund business. The SEC alleges that Loglisci repeatedly directed investment managers, who solicited him for investment business, to Morris or certain other individuals and signaled to the investment managers that they first needed to ""hire"" Morris as a finder or placement agent. Neither Morris nor anyone else who received the payments at issue allegedly performed legitimate placement or finder services for the investment management firms who made the payments. According to the SEC's complaint, the investment managers in some instances had already allegedly hired a finder or placement agent of their own and were already negotiating an investment with Loglisci when they were told that they also needed to ""hire"" Morris or another individual. Once the sham finder fee was agreed upon, Loglisci approved the proposed deal with the investment management firm. The SEC further asserts that Loglisci and Morris took steps to conceal these improper payments and quid pro quo arrangements from relevant members of the Comptroller's investment staff and the fund's Investment Advisory Committee. In some instances, the two men even arranged for investment managers to make payments to another individual who would then covertly funnel a portion of these sham fees to Morris, sometimes even without the knowledge of the investment managers. In addition, Morris allegedly paid the girlfriend of a high-ranking member of the Comptroller's staff nearly $100,000 in cash to ensure that the staff member would not ask questions or otherwise reveal the scheme to others. According to the evidence, Loglisci also personally benefited from his role in the scheme. In addition to receiving Morris's support for promotion to Deputy Comptroller, Loglisci obtained funding from Morris and the principal of a private equity firm for a low-budget film that Loglisci and his brothers produced. The SEC's complaint, which also charges three entities owned and controlled by Morris, alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

494,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Marietta, Ga.-based attorney for operating a Ponzi scheme that sold promissory notes to raise funds that were purportedly invested in real estate transactions, including private mortgages. The SEC alleges that Robert P. Copeland promoted investment opportunities verbally and through written materials with false claims of earning interest of 15 to 18 percent in a year or less. Copeland fraudulently raised more than $35 million from at least 140 investors in Georgia and several other states. Copeland actually used very little of the investor funds in connection with real estate acquisition or development, and instead deposited investor funds into four bank accounts in the name of his law firm. He used new investor funds to make payment obligations to earlier investors, and misappropriated millions of dollars for such personal expenses as his residence, vehicles, and expensive artwork. ""Copeland used his status as a legal professional and authority on estate planning to lure investors into a false sense of security,"" said Katherine Addleman, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. ""The SEC will continue to take swift action against attorneys and other individuals who abuse their position and status to defraud investors."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Copeland perpetrated the scheme from at least 2004 to January 2009 through entities that he controlled. Copeland directed the unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes evidencing investor loans, and represented to investors that the loans were safe and secured by real estate. The notes were often collateralized by security deeds to which Copeland signed the names of fictitious persons. The SEC's complaint alleges violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC's amended complaint, Wissman was a longtime family friend of Loglisci and a key participant in the kickback scheme. Wissman worked with Loglisci and Morris to extract sham finder fee payments for Morris and for himself from investment managers. Wissman received millions of dollars in sham fees and other illicit payments, and arranged millions of dollars in additional payments for Morris. In addition, Wissman caused HFV Management L.P. and HFV Asset Management L.P. to pay sham finder fees to Morris in one New York State Common Retirement Fund transaction. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Harding was a political ally who was allegedly inserted by Morris and Loglisci into at least two fund transactions for the sole purpose of compensating Harding, and Harding received a total of approximately $800,000 in sham ""finder"" fees. In one of those transactions, the investment management firm already had a finder and Morris arranged for that finder to secretly split his fee with Harding. In another transaction, Morris and Loglisci simply inserted Harding as a finder on an investment solely for the purpose of directing money to Harding.

Morris, Wissman, Harding and the others who received the payments at issue did not perform bona fide placement or finder services for the investment management firms that made the payments. The SEC's amended complaint additionally charges three entities through which Wissman perpetrated the fraud - Flandana Holdings Ltd., Tuscany Enterprises LLC, and W Investment Strategies LLC â as well as two investment management firms with which he was affiliated at the time, HFV Management L.P. and HFV Asset Management L.P. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Wissman was a longtime family friend of Loglisci and a key participant in the kickback scheme. Wissman worked with Loglisci and Morris to extract sham finder fee payments for Morris and for himself from investment managers. Wissman received millions of dollars in sham fees and other illicit payments, and arranged millions of dollars in additional payments for Morris. In addition, Wissman caused HFV Management L.P. and HFV Asset Management L.P. to pay sham finder fees to Morris in one New York State Common Retirement Fund transaction. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Harding was a political ally who was allegedly inserted by Morris and Loglisci into at least two fund transactions for the sole purpose of compensating Harding, and Harding received a total of approximately $800,000 in sham ""finder"" fees. In one of those transactions, the investment management firm already had a finder and Morris arranged for that finder to secretly split his fee with Harding. In another transaction, Morris and Loglisci simply inserted Harding as a finder on an investment solely for the purpose of directing money to Harding. In a partial settlement of the SEC's charges, Wissman and Flandana Holdings Ltd. have consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a partial final judgment that imposes all of the permanent injunctive relief sought in the amended complaint and defers the determination of disgorgement and financial penalties until a later date. In addition, HFV Management and HFV Asset Management have consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that orders them to pay a penalty in the aggregate amount of $150,000. The SEC's charges against Harding remain pending. The amended complaint alleges that Harding aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 committed by Morris and Loglisci.

502,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment adviser Hennessee Group LLC and its principal Charles J. Gradante with securities law violations for failing to perform their advertised review and analysis before recommending that their clients invest in the Bayou hedge funds that were later discovered to be a fraud. In a settled administrative proceeding, the Commission issued an order finding that Hennessee Group and Gradante did not perform key elements of the due diligence that they had represented they would conduct prior to recommending investments in the Bayou hedge funds. The SEC also finds that they failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into red flags concerning Bayou. Hennessee Group and Gradante routinely represented to clients and prospective clients that they would not recommend investments in hedge funds that did not satisfy all phases of their due diligence evaluation. ""Forewarned is forearmed â investment advisers must make good on their promises or face the consequences of vigorous SEC enforcement action,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""As the Commission found, these investment advisers failed to honor the representations they made to their clients and did not disclose these material departures from their advertised services,"" said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The advice that clients receive from hedge fund consultants is especially critical when the hedge funds are neither regulated nor transparent."" According to the Commission's order, approximately 40 clients invested millions of dollars in the Bayou hedge funds from February 2003 through August 2005 after the Hennessee Group recommended those investments. Most of the money was lost through trading or dissipated by Bayou's principals, who defrauded their investors by fabricating Bayou's performance in client account statements and year-end financial statements. The SEC charged the managers of the Bayou hedge funds with fraud in 2005. The Commission's order finds that Hennessee Group and Gradante failed to conduct the portfolio and trading analysis that it had advertised to clients. Instead of analyzing Bayou's results and processes through a review of Bayou's historical trading methods to determine whether the fund was, in fact, successfully executing its purported day-trading strategy, Hennessee Group and Gradante decided not to perform any analysis after Bayou refused to produce its trading data. They relied entirely on Bayou's uncorroborated representations about its strategy and its purported rates of return. The Commission's order also finds that despite conflicting reports from Bayou about the identity of their independent auditor, Hennessee Group and Gradante failed to verify Bayou's relationship with its auditor. In fact, the accounting firm that purportedly conducted Bayou's annual audit was a non-existent entity fabricated by one of Bayou's principals, who was identified in publicly available state accountancy board records as the registered agent for the bogus accounting firm. According to the Commission's order, Hennessee Group and Gradante also failed to respond to red flags concerning Bayou that came to their attention while they were monitoring Bayou on behalf of their clients. In particular, they failed to inquire or investigate when Bayou provided contradictory responses regarding the identity of its auditor or to adequately inquire about a rumor that one of Bayou's principals was affiliated with Bayou's purported outside auditing firm. The Commission's order finds that Hennessee Group and Gradante violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The order requires Hennessee Group and Gradante to pay $814,644.12 in disgorgement and penalties, and to cease and desist from committing or causing further violations. The parties also are required to adopt policies to ensure adequate disclosures in the future and to provide copies of the Commission's Order to all current and prospective clients for a period of two years. Hennessee Group and Gradante consented to the entry of the Commission's order without admitting or denying the findings.

503,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a Connecticut-based money manager and the hedge funds that he controls, alleging that he forged documents, promised false returns, and misrepresented assets managed by the funds to illicitly raise more than $30 million from investors. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Francesco Rusciano solicited investments for two hedge funds he controls â Ponta Negra Fund I, LLC and Ponta Negra Offshore Fund I, LTD â and also is the principal of Ponta Negra Group, LLC, which is located at his residence in Stamford, Conn. Specifically, the SEC alleges that on at least two occasions, Rusciano forged brokerage account statements to make it appear that a hedge fund account had millions of dollars more in assets than it actually had. ""Rusciano went to great lengths to deceive investors, and the SEC is committed to ensuring that money managers who provide inaccurate information to investors and fail to uphold their fiduciary duties are held responsible for their misconduct,"" said Rose Romero, Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. Pursuant to the SEC's motions for emergency relief for investors, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks entered a temporary restraining order, froze the defendants' assets, and ordered a hearing on the appointment of a receiver to marshal assets belonging to the funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Rusciano provided a selling agent with a Jan. 11, 2008, brokerage statement reflecting an account balance of more than $43 million for Ponta Negra Fund I. The SEC alleges that the correct balance for that account on that date was less than $3 million. Similarly, the SEC's complaint says that on Aug. 5, 2008, Rusciano produced to another selling agent a brokerage account statement reflecting an ""equity"" balance for Ponta Negra Fund LLC of more than $64 million. The SEC alleges that Rusciano altered the account statement by ""whiting out"" the word ""excess"" in the ""excess equity"" field on the account statement to make it appear as though the hedge fund's account had approximately $64 million, when in fact the account had less than $7 million. In addition to forging brokerage account statements, the SEC alleges that Rusciano misrepresented the hedge fund's monthly and yearly performance results. Rusciano falsely represented that the funds had consistently achieved positive results for every month throughout 2007 and 2008 when, in fact, the hedge funds lost money in 10 of the 24 months from March 2007 through March 2009 in the account that held most of the hedge fund's assets. The SEC also alleges that Rusciano misrepresented that the Ponta Negra hedge funds earned total annual returns of 42.99 percent for 2007, 24.85 percent for 2008, and 6.14 percent for the first two months of 2009. The account that held most of the Ponta Negra hedge funds' assets actually suffered substantial trading losses in 2007, had modest profits in 2008, and again sustained losses in 2009. The SEC further alleges that on April 21, 2009, Rusciano sent an e-mail to a selling agent detailing the hedge fund's assets under management. According to the e-mail, the Ponta Negra hedge funds had $59 million in assets under management as of February 2009. According to the SEC's complaint, the hedge funds had less than $10 million. The SEC's complaint charges, among other things, that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in this matter. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

504,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Dallas-based Aldus Equity Partners, L.P. and one of its founding principals, Saul Meyer, in connection with a multi-million dollar kickback scheme involving New York's largest pension fund. In an amended complaint attached to a motion filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Meyer and Aldus participated in a fraudulent kickback scheme in order to win investment business from the New York State Common Retirement Fund (Retirement Fund). The SEC previously charged Henry ""Hank"" Morris and David Loglisci for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to enrich Morris and other political allies and associates including Raymond Harding and Barrett Wissman, who have also been charged in the case. ""As alleged in our complaint, Aldus was chosen by the pension plan because of Aldus's willingness to illegally line the pockets of others,"" said James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""When another investment manager refused to pay kickbacks, that firm was rejected and Aldus cashed in."" The SEC alleges that Meyer caused Aldus to pay a shell company owned by Morris approximately $320,000 in sham finder fees, in exchange for which Loglisci caused the pension fund to invest a total of $375 million with Aldus from 2004 to 2006. The SEC's amended complaint further alleges that Loglisci ensured that Aldus and certain other investment managers who were willing to make the requisite payments to Morris and others were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied New York State Common Retirement Fund business. The scheme corrupted the integrity of the Retirement Fund's investment processes and resulted in the retirement fund's assets being invested with the undisclosed purpose of enriching Morris and certain others. The SEC alleges that Loglisci chose Aldus as the Retirement Fund's emerging fund portfolio manager on the sole basis of Meyer's willingness to pay Morris. Prior to selecting Aldus, the New York State Comptroller's office had been in discussions with another investment manager about creating and managing an emerging fund portfolio for the Retirement Fund. When that investment manager refused to pay kickbacks to Morris, Loglisci rejected that firm and recruited Aldus to manage the Retirement Fund's emerging fund portfolio. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Aldus was serving as the Retirement Fund's outside consultant at the time, making Aldus a fiduciary of the Retirement Fund. In the midst of Aldus's negotiations to manage the Retirement Fund's emerging fund portfolio, a close associate of Morris approached Meyer and assured Meyer that Aldus would win the contract if Aldus agreed to pay Morris a portion of the management fees that Aldus received from the Retirement Fund.

505,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Dallas-based Aldus Equity Partners, L.P. and one of its founding principals, Saul Meyer, in connection with a multi-million dollar kickback scheme involving New York's largest pension fund. In an amended complaint attached to a motion filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Meyer and Aldus participated in a fraudulent kickback scheme in order to win investment business from the New York State Common Retirement Fund (Retirement Fund). The SEC previously charged Henry ""Hank"" Morris and David Loglisci for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to enrich Morris and other political allies and associates including Raymond Harding and Barrett Wissman, who have also been charged in the case. ""As alleged in our complaint, Aldus was chosen by the pension plan because of Aldus's willingness to illegally line the pockets of others,"" said James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""When another investment manager refused to pay kickbacks, that firm was rejected and Aldus cashed in."" The SEC alleges that Meyer caused Aldus to pay a shell company owned by Morris approximately $320,000 in sham finder fees, in exchange for which Loglisci caused the pension fund to invest a total of $375 million with Aldus from 2004 to 2006. The SEC's amended complaint further alleges that Loglisci ensured that Aldus and certain other investment managers who were willing to make the requisite payments to Morris and others were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied New York State Common Retirement Fund business. The scheme corrupted the integrity of the Retirement Fund's investment processes and resulted in the retirement fund's assets being invested with the undisclosed purpose of enriching Morris and certain others. The SEC alleges that Loglisci chose Aldus as the Retirement Fund's emerging fund portfolio manager on the sole basis of Meyer's willingness to pay Morris. Prior to selecting Aldus, the New York State Comptroller's office had been in discussions with another investment manager about creating and managing an emerging fund portfolio for the Retirement Fund.

507,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Citigroup investment banker for repeatedly tipping his brother about upcoming merger deals in an insider trading scheme that involved friends and family throughout Northern California and the Midwest and reaped more than $6 million in illicit profits. The SEC alleges that Maher Kara, a former director in Citigroup Global Markets' investment banking division in New York, repeatedly told his brother Michael Kara of Walnut Creek, Calif., about upcoming deals involving Citigroup's health care industry clients. The SEC further alleges that Michael Kara, in addition to buying stock and options in target companies that were the subject of the Citigroup deals, leaked the information to a network of friends and family who also traded in advance of the deals. The SEC has charged the Kara brothers and six others in the case. ""Insider trading exposes publicly-traded companies and their shareholders to serious harm, and damages the integrity of the markets,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""In this case, an investment bank professional violated the trust of his employer and the clients who relied on the bank's confidential advice."" Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""We are charging not only the person who stole the information from his employer, but also those who received and then traded on that information. These individuals netted millions of dollars in illegal windfall profits by trading on confidential information they knew was obtained improperly."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Michael Kara is a self-employed environmental clean-up consultant who traded in at least 20 companies that were involved in confidential transactions pending in the Citigroup health care investment banking group where Maher Kara worked. In many cases, Michael Kara also tipped friends and family members in California and Illinois. The participants in the scheme made their biggest profits trading in the stock and options of San Diego, Calif.-based medical testing company Biosite, Inc., less than three days before a March 25, 2007, announcement that it would be acquired. According to the SEC's complaint, Maher Kara tipped his brother on March 22 about the confidential merger negotiations, and less than 15 minutes later Michael Kara began acquiring a large volume of Biosite stock and short-term call options. That same day, Michael Kara began calling friends and family members to pass along the tip, and they too began buying Biosite securities. After the acquisition of Biosite was publicly disclosed days later, the stock price jumped over 50 percent. Michael Kara made illegal profits of more than $1.2 million, while his six tippees together made nearly $4 million. In addition to the Kara brothers, the SEC also charged: The SEC's complaint alleges that Maher Kara, who is now residing in San Carlos, Calif., also tipped his brother about a planned March 2006 acquisition of Andrx Corporation, a Florida drug manufacturer. Michael Kara allegedly made nearly $400,000 in illegal profits trading on the tip, and passed the information to Jilwan, Haddad, Azar, and Salman (who then tipped Bayyouk). Together, they made an additional $750,000 when the Andrx acquisition was announced. In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. AttorneyÂs Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced the criminal indictment of Maher Kara, Michael Kara, and Emile Jilwan. Two of Michael Kara's tippees, Nasser Mardini and Joseph Azar, have agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Mardini has agreed to repay illegal profits, and Azar has agreed to repay illegal profits and pay a penalty. In its non-settled enforcement action against the remaining defendants, the SEC seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, financial penalties, and other relief. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California in this matter.

508,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Julio Ramirez, Jr., who was formerly affiliated with Los Angeles-based broker-dealers DAV/Wetherly Financial L.P. and Park Hill Group LLC, in connection with a multi-million dollar kickback scheme involving New York's largest pension fund. In an amended complaint attached to a motion filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Ramirez participated in the fraudulent scheme by helping his friend and associate Henry ""Hank"" Morris extract kickback payments from Aldus Equity Partners, an investment management firm that was seeking to win investment business from the New York State Common Retirement Fund (Retirement Fund). The SEC previously charged Morris and David Loglisci for orchestrating the wide-ranging scheme to enrich Morris and others, and charged Aldus and one of its founding principals, Saul Meyer, for participating in the scheme by agreeing to pay kickbacks to Morris. ""As alleged in our complaint, Ramirez conspired to extract kickback payments from an investment advisor who was seeking pension fund business,"" said James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""Ramirez facilitated Morris's scheme by contacting Meyer and making clear to him that Aldus must pay a kickback to gain privileged access to the hard-earned contributions of New York State's public employees."" According to the SEC's amended complaint, although Aldus was already negotiating with the Retirement Fund's investment staff about the proposed investment at the time, Aldus agreed to kick back 35 percent of its management fees to a shell entity run by Morris. Ramirez was in turn paid a portion of those fees by Morris. As a result of the quid pro quo arrangement, Aldus secured the Retirement Fund's emerging fund portfolio business, and Ramirez shared in the profits even though he performed no legitimate services. The SEC's amended complaint alleges that Ramirez aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

509,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 10 brokers with fraud for falsely marketing investments in derivatives of mortgage-backed securities as safe and suitable for retirees and others with conservative investment goals. The SEC alleges that the brokers enriched themselves with millions of dollars in commissions and salaries while the investors suffered millions of dollars in losses. According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal district court in West Palm Beach, Fla., the 10 brokers worked for Irvine, Calif.-based Brookstreet Securities Corp., which has since gone out of business. The SEC alleges that the brokers did not clearly define the risks to customers before investing their money in particularly risky Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs). The SECâs complaint charges Florida residents William Betta, Jr., James J. Caprio, Troy L. Gagliardi, Barry M. Kornfeld, Clifford A. Popper, Alfred B. Rubin, and Steven I. Shrago as well as Travis A. Branch of Kailua, Hawaii, Russell M. Kautz of Medford, Ore., and Shane A. McCann of Florence, Mont. âThese brokers disguised the risks of investing in these derivatives of mortgage-backed securities, exposing their customers to substantial losses as the subprime crisis emerged,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThey disregarded their customersâ needs and used deceptive and misleading tactics to enrich themselves at their clientsâ expense.â Rosalind R. Tyson, Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office, added, âThese brokers took customers primarily interested in protecting their money and pushed them into risky derivative investments through blatant misrepresentations.â According to the SECâs complaint, the defendants portrayed particularly risky types of CMOs as secure investments to defraud more than 750 customers, ultimately costing them more than $36 million in losses. Meanwhile, the 10 brokers received $18 million in commissions and salaries related to their customersâ investments in CMOs. The SEC alleges that contrary to the representations they made to their customers, the defendants invested in risky types of CMOs that were highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and jeopardized customersâ yield and principal. They were not all guaranteed by the U.S. government as the defendants told their customers, and they were not suitable for retirees or investors with conservative investment objectives. The SEC further alleges that the defendants told customers that they only sparingly would use margin, which is the ability to borrow money to purchase CMOs. In fact, they heavily margined customersâ accounts, resulting in the more than $36 million in losses. The SECâs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

510,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former Countrywide Financial CEO Angelo Mozilo and two other former executives with securities fraud for deliberately misleading investors about the significant credit risks being taken in efforts to build and maintain the company's market share. Mozilo was additionally charged with insider trading for selling his Countrywide stock based on non-public information for nearly $140 million in profits. The SEC alleges that Mozilo along with former chief operating officer and president David Sambol and former chief financial officer Eric Sieracki misled the market by falsely assuring investors that Countrywide was primarily a prime quality mortgage lender that had avoided the excesses of its competitors. The SEC's enforcement action alleges that from 2005 through 2007, Countrywide engaged in an unprecedented expansion of its underwriting guidelines and was writing riskier and riskier loans, which these senior executives were warned might ultimately curtail the company's ability to sell them. Countrywide was required to disclose these important trends to its investors in the Management Discussion and Analysis portion of its SEC filings, but failed to do so. ""This is the tale of two companies,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Countrywide portrayed itself as underwriting mainly prime quality mortgages using high underwriting standards. But concealed from shareholders was the true Countrywide, an increasingly reckless lender assuming greater and greater risk. Angelo Mozilo privately described one Countrywide product as 'toxic,' and said another's performance was so uncertain that Countrywide was 'flying blind.'"" Rosalind Tyson, Director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, added, ""Angelo Mozilo had access to detailed and alarming information about Countrywide's operations. He knew that Countrywide was gambling with increasingly risky mortgages and he kept those details from investors while he was actively taking his own chips off the table."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Countrywide's annual reports for 2005, 2006, and 2007 misled investors in claiming that Countrywide ""manage[d] credit risk through credit policy, underwriting, quality control and surveillance activities."" Its annual reports for 2005 and 2006 falsely stated that the company ensured its ""access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages."" The annual report for 2006 also falsely claimed that Countrywide had ""prudently underwritten"" its Pay-Option ARM loans. The SEC alleges that Mozilo, Sambol, and Sieracki actually knew, and acknowledged internally, that Countrywide was writing increasingly risky loans and that defaults and delinquencies would rise as a result, both in loans that Countrywide serviced and loans that the company packaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities. According to the SEC's complaint, Countrywide developed what was internally referred to as a ""supermarket"" strategy that widened underwriting guidelines to match any product offered by its competitors. By the end of 2006, Countrywide's underwriting guidelines were as wide as they had ever been, and Countrywide made an increasing number of loans based on exceptions to those already wide guidelines, even though exception loans had a higher rate of default. The SEC's complaint alleges that Mozilo believed that the risk was so high that he repeatedly urged that Countrywide sell its entire portfolio of Pay-Option loans. Despite these severe concerns about the increasing risks that Countrywide was undertaking, Mozilo, Sambol, and Sieracki hid these risks from the investing public. The SEC further alleges that Mozilo engaged in insider trading of Countrywide stock that he owned. Mozilo established four executive stock sale plans for himself in October, November, and December 2006 while he was aware of material, non-public information concerning Countrywide's increasing credit risk and the expected poor performance of Countrywide-originated loans. From November 2006 through August 2007, Mozilo exercised more than 5.1 million stock options and sold the underlying shares for total proceeds of nearly $140 million, pursuant to written trading plans adopted in late 2006 and early 2007. The SEC's complaint alleges that each of the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Mozilo and Sieracki violated Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, officer and director bars, and financial penalties against all of the defendants and the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against Mozilo and Sambol.

511,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Boston-based Evergreen Investment Management Company LLC and an affiliate with securities law violations for overstating the value of a mutual fund that invested primarily in mortgage-backed securities, and then only selectively telling shareholders about the fundâs valuation problems.

This enforcement action is the result of the joint efforts of the SEC and the Massachusetts Securities Division, which also brought related charges against the Evergreen entities today. The SECâs enforcement action against Evergreenâs investment advisory arm and its distributor, Evergreen Investment Services, Inc., found that the value of its Ultra Short Opportunities Fund, which was consistently ranked as a high performer in its class in 2007 and 2008, was inflated by as much as 17 percent due to Evergreenâs improper valuation practices. Had Evergreen properly valued the fund, it would have ranked near the bottom of its category during this time, the SEC found. According to the SECâs order, when Evergreen began to address the fundâs overstated value by re-pricing certain holdings, it only disclosed the reasons and the likelihood for additional re-pricings to select shareholders, who were then able to cash out before incurring any additional drop in the value of their fund shares. Meanwhile, other shareholders were left uninformed. âBy picking and choosing to disclose negative information to some investors and not others, Evergreen gave certain shareholders an unfair advantage and left others in the dark,â said David P. Bergers, Director of the SECâs Boston Regional Office. âEvergreen harmed investors and prevented them from making informed decisions by overstating the value of its holdings in mortgage-backed securities.â The SECâs order found that Evergreen overstated the fundâs value by failing to properly take into account readily available information about certain mortgage-backed securities in the valuation process. The fundâs portfolio management team also withheld negative information about certain of the fund's securities from an Evergreen committee responsible for valuations. Evergreen closed the Ultra Fund in June 2008 in the wake of substantial redemptions by fund shareholders following the firmâs re-pricing of the fundâs holdings.

513,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two accountants who produced bogus financial statements and an Antiguan regulator who took bribes to look the other way as Robert Allen Stanford conducted an alleged $8 billion Ponzi scheme. The SEC previously charged Stanford and his companies â Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank (SIB), Houston-based broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company (SGC), and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management â as well as SIB chief financial officer James Davis and Stanford Financial Group chief investment officer Laura Pendergest-Holt with securities fraud in an enforcement action filed in federal court in Dallas on February 17. The SEC amended its complaint today to additionally charge Mark Kuhrt and Gilberto Lopez, accountants for Stanford-affiliated companies who allegedly fabricated financial statements to give investors the false illusion that their investments were solid, safe and secure. The SEC also charged Leroy King, the administrator and chief executive officer of Antigua's Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC), for accepting thousands of dollars per month in bribes to ignore the Stanford Ponzi scheme and supply Stanford himself with confidential information about the SEC's investigation. King obstructed the SEC's case since 2005, when its investigation into Stanford began. ""Instead of buying the safe and sound investments he promised his clients, Stanford bought Antigua's top securities cop,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""While Stanford quarterbacked his massive Ponzi scheme, he paid the referee to spy on the huddles and provide an insider's play-by-play of the SEC's investigation."" Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ""Phony financial statements, fabricated performance numbers, and sham audits are at the heart of Stanford's fraudulent scheme that swindled billions of dollars from investors worldwide. King, Kurht and Lopez abused their expertise and positions of authority to help make it all possible."" The SEC's additional charges today are in coordination with criminal authorities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) today simultaneously announced federal fraud charges against Stanford, Davis, Pendergast-Holt, King, Kuhrt, and Lopez. The DOJ also charged King, Kuhrt, and Lopez with conspiracy to obstruct the SEC's investigation. The DOJ previously charged Pendergast-Holt with obstruction of justice in the SEC's investigation. According to the SEC's complaint, Kuhrt and Lopez used a pre-determined return on investment number (typically provided by Stanford or Davis) to reverse-engineer the SIB's financial statements and report investment income that the bank did not actually earn. Information in SIB's financial statements and annual reports to investors bore no relationship to the actual performance of the bank investments. The SEC's complaint alleges that King facilitated the Ponzi scheme by ensuring that the FSRC conducted sham audits and examinations of SIB's books and records. In exchange for bribes paid to him over a period of several years, King made sure that the FSRC did not examine SIB's investment portfolio. King also provided Stanford with access to the FSRC's confidential regulatory files on him, including the SEC's requests for information from FSRC in its investigation. King went so far as to allow Stanford to essentially dictate the FSRC's responses to the SEC on those information requests. King made false assurances that there was no cause for concern about Stanford International Bank. He collaborated with Stanford to withhold significant information being requested by the SEC. According to the SEC's complaint, King is a citizen of the U.S. as well as Antigua and Barbuda, West Indies. He maintains residences in both Atlanta and Antigua. Lopez lives in Spring, Texas, and worked in SFG's Houston office as the chief accounting officer of SFG and its affiliate, Stanford Financial Group Global Management, LLC (SFGGM). Lopez provided accounting services to many entities under Stanford's control, including SIB, SFG and SFGGM. Kuhrt is a resident of Christiansted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, and is the global controller for SFGGM. He provided accounting services to many entities under Stanford's control, including SIB, SFG, and SFGGM. Kuhrt reported at various times to Lopez and Davis, but also directly to Stanford. Neither Lopez nor Kuhrt is a certified public accountant (CPA). The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas, the FBI, the IRS, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and FINRA.

516,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based broker-dealer and four individuals with securities fraud, alleging that they collectively raised billions of dollars from investors for Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC charged Cohmad Securities Corporation as well as its chairman Maurice J. Cohn, chief operating officer Marcia B. Cohn, and registered representative Robert M. Jaffe for actively marketing investment opportunities with Madoff while knowingly or recklessly disregarding facts indicating that Madoff was operating a fraud. In a separate complaint filed in the same court, the SEC charged California-based investment adviser Stanley Chais, who oversaw three funds that invested all of their assets with Madoff. When the Ponzi scheme collapsed, Chais investors' accounts were valued at nearly $1 billion. The SEC previously charged Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) as well as their auditors with committing securities fraud through a Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of BMIS. ""Madoff cultivated an air of exclusivity by pretending that he was too successful to trouble himself with marketing to new investors,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""In fact, he needed a constant in-flow of funds to sustain his fraud, and used his secret control of Cohmad to obtain them."" James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, added, ""These Madoff solicitors collectively received several hundred million dollars in fees over the past few decades while Madoff ruined the finances of countless investors."" The SEC's complaint against the Cohmad defendants alleges that while bringing investors to Madoff, they ignored and even participated in many suspicious practices that clearly indicated Madoff was engaged in fraud. For example, the SEC's complaint alleges that the Cohns and Cohmad filed false Forms BD and FOCUS reports that concealed Cohmad's primary business of bringing in investors for BMIS. This referral business comprised as much as 90 percent of Cohmad's revenue in some years, brought in more than 800 accounts, and billions of dollars into BMIS' advisory business, for which BMIS paid them more than $100 million. The SEC's complaint also alleges that the compensation arrangement between BMIS and Cohmad indicated fraudulent conduct at BMIS. Cohmad was paid an annual percentage of the funds its representatives (except Jaffe) brought into BMIS offset by any withdrawals from those investor accounts. This compensation arrangement indicated to Cohmad and the Cohns that BMIS was not providing any real returns to investors. For example, where the client's principal investment had been $10,000, Cohmad stopped receiving fees if a client withdrew $15,000 from an account, even if under BMIS' management the account had purportedly grown to $100,000. In Cohmad's internal records, such an account was designated with a negative $5,000 number. The SEC alleges that Jaffe also participated in Madoff's fraud by soliciting investors and bringing more than $1 billion into BMIS. The SEC's complaint alleges, among other things, that Madoff compensated Jaffe with outsized returns in Jaffe's personal accounts that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were manufactured by BMIS employees entering fictitious, backdated trades onto trade confirmations and account statements for his personal accounts at BMIS. The SEC's complaint alleges that Chais committed fraud by misrepresenting his role in managing the funds' assets and for distributing account statements that he should have known were false. According to the SEC's complaint, for the last 40 years, Chais has held himself out as an investing wizard who managed hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds in three partnerships, the Lambeth, Popham and Brighton Companies (the Funds). Chais made a number of misrepresentations over the years to the Funds' investors indicating that he formulated and executed the Funds' trading strategy. In reality, Chais was an unsophisticated investor who did nothing more than turn all of the Funds' assets over to Madoff, while charging the Funds more than $250 million in fees for his purported ""services."" Although Madoff managed all of the Funds' assets, many of the Funds' investors had never heard of Madoff before the collapse of his Ponzi scheme, and had not known that Chais invested with Madoff until Chais informed them after Madoff's arrest. The SEC also alleges that Chais ignored red flags indicating that Madoff's reported returns were false. For example, Chais told Madoff that Chais did not want there to be any losses on any of the Funds' trades. Madoff complied with Chais's request, and from 1999 to 2008, despite reportedly executing thousands of trades on behalf of the Funds, Madoff did not report a loss on a single equities trade. Chais however, with the assistance of his accountant, prepared account statements for the Funds' investors based upon the Madoff statements, and continued to distribute them to the Funds' investors even though he should have known they were false. According to the SEC's complaint, Chais also opened and exercised control over approximately 60 other accounts at Madoff's firm on behalf of his family members and related entities. Taking all of these accounts collectively, between 1995 and 2008, Chais and his family members and related entities withdrew more than $500 million more than they actually invested with Madoff. The SEC's complaint against the Cohmad defendants specifically alleges that Cohmad violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; that the Cohns violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; and that Robert Jaffe violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder. The SEC's complaint against Chais specifically alleges that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

518,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chief accounting officer of Atlanta-based home builder Beazer Homes, USA, Inc., for conducting a multi-year fraudulent earnings management scheme and misleading Beazer's outside auditors and internal Beazer accountants in order to conceal his wrongdoing. The SEC alleges that Michael T. Rand of Sandy Springs, Ga., fraudulently decreased Beazer's reported net income by recording improper accounting reserves during certain periods between 2000 and 2005 in order to meet or exceed analysts' expectations for Beazer's diluted earnings per share (EPS) and maximize yearly officer and senior employee bonuses. Rand began reversing these improper reserves beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 in order to offset Beazer's declining financial performance. ""Michael Rand orchestrated an old-fashioned 'cookie jar' earnings management scheme where he hid from view over $60 million in so-called reserves,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Then when Beazer's business declined, he fraudulently reversed those secret reserves and appeased financial analysts, enticed new investors, and most importantly earned himself an undeserved lucrative bonus."" The SEC also alleges that in fiscal year 2006 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2007, Rand improperly recognized revenue from the sale and leaseback of certain model homes on Beazer's financial statements and used secret side agreements in order to hide his misconduct from Beazer's outside auditors. Cumulatively, Rand's actions caused Beazer to understate its income in SEC filings by approximately $63 million during fiscal years 2000 to 2005, representing approximately 7 percent of Beazer's cumulative actual restated net income of $955 million for the period. Rand's fraudulent actions caused Beazer to overstate its income and understate its loss by a total of $47 million during fiscal 2006 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2007, representing 20 percent of Beazer's cumulative actual restated net income of $232 million for the period. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Rand with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of Rand's ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty. The SEC also seeks a court order barring Rand from acting as an officer or director of any public issuer.

519,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained an emergency asset freeze in a $485 million offering fraud and Ponzi scheme orchestrated by three Dallas businessmen through a company they owned and controlled, Provident Royalties LLC. The SEC alleges that from at least June 2006 through January 2009, Provident made a series of fraudulent securities offerings involving oil and gas assets through 21 affiliated entities to more than 7,700 investors throughout the United States. Providents entities made some direct retail sales of securities, but primarily solicited retail broker-dealers to enter into placement agreements for each offering, and those retail broker-dealers sold the stock to retail investors nationwide. According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Provident falsely promised yearly returns of up to 18 percent and misrepresented to investors that 85 percent of the funds raised through the offerings would be used to purchase interests in oil and gas real estate, leases, mineral rights, and interests, exploration and development. In fact, the SEC alleges that less than 50 percent of investor funds were used for their stated purpose, and the proceeds from later offerings were used to pay expenses related to earlier offerings and returns to investors in those offerings. Provident sold ostensibly safe securities such as preferred stock to thousands of investors, said Ken Israel, Director of the SECs Salt Lake Regional Office. But it was actually operating a Ponzi-like shell game in which assets were shuttled from one entity to another and investors were paid returns from whatever money was available  usually that of the most recent investors. The SECs complaint charges Paul R. Melbye, Brendan Coughlin and Henry Harrison for orchestrating the scheme, as well as Provident, broker-dealer Provident Asset Management LLC, and the 21 entities that offered and sold securities. Although each offering was made by a separate entity through a separate private placement, the Commission alleges that the offerings actually involved a single plan of financing. In addition to the asset freeze, the court has appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors. The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and financial penalties.

520,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based broker-dealer Sky Capital LLC and six individuals involved in a fraudulent boiler room scheme that raised millions of dollars from U.S. and UK investors who were then restricted from selling their stock, and their investments later became worthless. The SEC alleges that the firm's founder, president and CEO Ross Mandell directed Sky Capital brokers to make material misrepresentations, omit material information, and use high-pressure sales tactics to induce customers to purchase stock in two related companies â Sky Capital Holdings Ltd. and Sky Capital Enterprises, Inc. (Sky Entities). Sky Capital brokers used scripts to solicit investors for the private placements, and based their sales pitches on what Mandell told them. The brokers enjoyed hefty undisclosed commissions and other perks, and Mandell used investor funds to subsidize his own lifestyle including expensive travel and hotels, adult entertainment, and child care expenses. ""Boiler room tactics like those used by Sky Capital and its brokers undercut the level of honesty and fair play we seek to maintain in the securities markets,"" said James Clarkson, Acting Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""This firm and these brokers went to great lengths to repeatedly lie to investors, pressuring them into buying stock without telling them it would be nearly impossible to sell those shares."" In addition to Sky Capital and Mandell, who resides in Boca Raton, Fla., the SEC's complaint charges the firm's former chief operating officer Stephen Shea of Brooklyn and four former registered representatives at the firm: Robert Grabowski of Staten Island, Adam Harrington (a/k/a Adam Rukdeschel) of Miami, Fla., Michael Passaro of Delray Beach, Fla., and Arn Wilson of Concord, N.C. Sky Capital is also known as Granta Capital LLC. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Sky Capital raised more than $61 million from investors between September 2002 and November 2006. Sky Capital implemented and enforced a ""no net sales"" policy that essentially prevented investors from selling their Sky Entities stocks that were otherwise publicly traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. Customers were not told that they would be unable to sell their shares, and the no net sales policy helped artificially inflate the price of the Sky Entities stocks. When trading in those stocks was suspended by the London Stock Exchange in 2006, the investments were rendered worthless. The SEC alleges that Mandell enforced the no net sales policy by holding meetings with Sky Capital brokers to inform them that they needed to find buyers for the Sky Entities' stocks being sold by other Sky Capital customers to alleviate ""selling pressure"" on the stocks. Mandell told brokers that they had to find a buyer before the broker could submit a sell ticket. According to the SEC's complaint, Mandell bullied brokers who submitted customer sell orders without first lining up a buyer, and accused them of not being a ""team player."" Mandell also denied perks to brokers who did not follow the no net sales policy. Sky Capital often paid for parking, cell phones, and other personal expenses incurred by the brokers. But if a broker did not ""support the stock,"" Mandell would take away the broker's perks. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Shea with aiding and abetting the other defendants' violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint also charges Sky Capital with violating Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, and Mandell with aiding and abetting Sky Capital's violation of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Mandell from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company.

521,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an enforcement action against Minneapolis-based broker-dealer Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc., for receiving millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation as a condition for offering and selling certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) to its brokerage customers. Ameriprise agreed to pay $17.3 million to settle the SEC's charges. REITs are entities that invest in different kinds of real estate or real estate-related assets such as office buildings, retail stores, and hotels. The SEC's order finds that Ameriprise demanded and received so-called ""revenue sharing"" payments related to its sales of REITs and failed to disclose the payments as required. Ameriprise also sold more than $100 million of unregistered shares of one particular REIT in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. ""Few things are more important to investors than getting unbiased advice from their financial advisers,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Ameriprise customers were not informed about the incentives its brokers had to sell these investments."" The SEC's order finds that neither Ameriprise nor the REITs disclosed to investors that additional payments were being made in connection with the sale of REIT shares, or the conflicts of interest these additional payments created. The SEC's order also finds that Ameriprise issued a variety of mislabeled invoices to the REITs as a means of collecting the undisclosed revenue sharing payments that appeared to be legitimate reimbursements for services provided by Ameriprise. The SEC censured Ameriprise and ordered it to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 5(a), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-10. The SEC also ordered Ameriprise to pay $17.3 million in disgorgement and financial penalties. Ameriprise has consented to the issuance of the SEC's order without admitting or denying the findings.

522,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze against a Highland Park, Ill.-based hedge fund manager and his firm for facilitating a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme operated by Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleges that Gregory Bell and Lancelot Management LLC invested more than $2 billion in hedge funds assets with Petters and pocketed millions of dollars in fraudulent fees at the expense of investors in the funds. The SEC's complaint also charges Petters with fraud for perpetrating the massive Ponzi scheme through the sale of notes related to consumer electronics. When Petters's scheme began to unravel, Bell participated in a series of sham transactions to conceal that Petters owed more than $130 million in investor payments on the notes. Bell, Lancelot Management, and the hedge funds they manage have never been registered with the SEC or any other regulatory agency. ""Greg Bell portrayed himself as a helping hand to investors  avidly protecting their funds and verifying the legitimacy of Petters's business. But behind their backs, he was handing over billions of dollars of his clients' money to feed a fraud,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Bell lied to investors to induce them to hand over their money, and then hung them out to dry while millions of dollars in fees continued to flow into his own pockets,"" said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. ""Our enforcement action seeks the return of fraudulently collected fees to defrauded investors."" At the SEC's request for emergency relief for investors, the Hon. Ann D. Montgomery, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, issued a court order freezing all assets of Bell and Lancelot Management as well as relief defendants, including Bell's wife Inna Goldman. Among other things, the court order requires that they repatriate all overseas assets to the United States. Petters was previously charged by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota in early October 2008, and his assets were frozen at that time. He is in custody awaiting trial. According to the SEC's complaint, Petters carried out his Ponzi scheme from as early as 1995 through September 2008, promising investors that proceeds from the notes they were sold would be used to finance the purchase of vast amounts of consumer electronics by vendors who then re-sold the merchandise to ""Big Box"" retailers including such well-known chains as Wal-Mart and Costco. Instead, the ""purchase order inventory financing"" business was a complete sham, and the vendors secretly returned most investor money back to Petters, who diverted billions of dollars for his own purposes. The SEC alleges that Petters sold the notes to several feeder funds that in turn raised their investment capital from hundreds of private investors in the U.S. and abroad. Beginning in 2002, Bell and Lancelot Management raised approximately $2.62 billion from hundreds of investors through the sale of interests in three hedge funds they managed (Lancelot Investors Fund, L.P., Lancelot Investors Fund II, L.P., and Lancelot Investors Fund, Ltd.). The investors included individuals, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, trusts, corporations, partnerships, and other hedge funds. Bell and Lancelot Investment used almost all of the fund assets to purchase notes offered by Petters and his companies. The SEC's complaint alleges: False Assurances  Bell and Lancelot Management falsely assured investors that they were taking specific steps to protect investor money and to verify the legitimacy of Petters's financing business, when in fact they did not. Bell and Lancelot Management also failed to inform investors that Petters was previously convicted of multiple crimes involving fraud and deception. Bogus Roundtrips  Beginning around February 2008 after Petters had been delinquent for months in repaying more than $130 million of notes, Bell and Petters concocted a series of bogus ""roundtrip"" payments to conceal Petters's delinquencies. Bell and Lancelot Management on multiple occasions sent money directly to Petters's company under the pretense that the money was for investment in a new note. Petters, through his employees, then returned the money to Bell and Lancelot Management, typically on the same day. It was packaged as the repayment of one of the outstanding debts owed to the Lancelot hedge funds. Wrongful Withdrawals  During the final months before the collapse of the Petters Ponzi scheme, Bell and Lancelot Management wrongfully withdrew more than $40 million from the Lancelot Funds as purported fees. Bell and Lancelot Management also transferred millions to an account he controls jointly with his wife as well as a revocable trust in his name and a revocable trust in his wife's name. Bell also transferred millions to an account in Switzerland for the benefit of a third trust. The SEC's complaint charges Bell, Lancelot Management and Petters with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Bell and Lancelot Management with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8). The SEC seeks entry of a court order of permanent injunction against Bell, Lancelot Management and Petters, as well as an order of disgorgement, including prejudgment interest and financial penalties. The SEC also seeks an order requiring the relief defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

523,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Seattle-based securities lawyer David Otto and several others with conducting a fraudulent âpump-and-dumpâ scheme in which they secretly unloaded more than $1 million in penny stock of a company touting non-existent anti-aging products. The SEC alleges that a series of misleading press releases and Web profiles were used to tout purported beverages and nutritional supplements of Seattle-based MitoPharm Corporation. With claims that its products had anti-aging benefits from an ingredient extracted from a berry used in traditional Chinese medicine, MitoPharmâs stock price more than quadrupled during the aggressive stock promotion campaign. However, the SEC alleges that MitoPharmâs products were not âavailableâ as advertised and were still in the developmental stage. Full-color photos featuring beverage cans and pill bottles were only mock-ups of non-existent products. âAttorneys are supposed to function as gatekeepers in the securities industry,â said Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SECâs San Francisco Regional Office. âOtto and his firm used phony documents to corner the market in a start-up companyâs stock, and then profited at the expense of unsuspecting investors when the stock-promoting campaign caused the share price to briefly skyrocket before plummeting back down to earth.â The SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, charges Otto, his associate Todd Van Siclen of Seattle, and Houston-based stock promoter Charles Bingham and his company Wall Street PR, Inc. MitoPharm and its CEO Pak Peter Cheung of Vancouver were also charged. According to the SECâs complaint, the scheme began in late 2006 when Otto, who was hired by Cheung, arranged to purchase a publicly traded shell company as a merger partner for MitoPharm. Otto and Van Siclen drafted opinion letters to MitoPharmâs transfer agent filled with false statements in order to secure supposedly âfreely tradableâ stock certificates for individuals and entities secretly controlled by Otto. The SECâs complaint alleges that Cheung hired Bingham on Ottoâs recommendation, and they embarked on an aggressive public relations campaign that centered on the misleading promotion of two key products â âRestoradeâ and âStamina Solutionsâ â that did not exist. They developed promotional materials that falsely stated that both Restorade and Stamina Solution were â[a]vailable as functional beverage or as a soft gel capsule.â According to the SECâs complaint, Cheung had a graphics artist create renderings of what the containers for MitoPharmâs products could look like in order to accompany the written text of MitoPharmâs Web site and other promotional materials. Written materials and Web profiles created by Bingham and others were disseminated to investors with the fake images and present-tense descriptions of the products. The SEC further alleges that as the promotional campaign caused the stock price to rise above $2.30, Otto sold his shares for more than $1 million and Bingham netted an additional $300,000. The massive selling of the stock caused the price to fall to a nickel per share by November 2007. The SECâs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and financial penalties from the defendants as well as penny stock bars for Otto, Van Siclen, and Cheung, and an officer-and-director bar against Cheung.

524,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Morgan Stanley and one of the firmâs former investment adviser representatives with securities law violations for misleading clients about the money managers being recommended to them and failing to disclose conflicts of interest. According to the SECâs orders in the case, Morgan Stanley breached its fiduciary duty to advisory clients in its Nashville, Tenn., branch office by making material misstatements about a program through which the firm assisted clients in developing investment objectives and in selecting properly vetted money managers. Contrary to its disclosures, Morgan Stanley recommended some money managers who had not been approved for participation in the firmâs advisory programs and had not been subject to the firmâs due diligence review. William Keith Phillips of Nashville, then a top producer at Morgan Stanley, steered clients to three unapproved managers in particular. Unbeknownst to investors, Morgan Stanley and Phillips received substantial brokerage commissions or fees from these three unapproved managers. Morgan Stanley has agreed to settle the SECâs charges and pay a $500,000 penalty. âInvestment advisers are required to put investor interests ahead of their own and provide their clients with complete and truthful information at all times,â said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âMorgan Stanley said one thing and did another when recommending money managers who had not been properly vetted by the firm, and Phillips repeatedly disregarded Morgan Stanleyâs policies and procedures and reaped undisclosed financial benefits from these unapproved managers.â According to the SECâs orders, the misconduct spanned from 2000 to at least April 2006. Morgan Stanley assisted clients in selecting from a list of money managers approved to participate in its Vision I program and manage clientsâ assets. Morgan Stanley described to clients that a detailed due diligence process was followed to select and approve money managers for Morgan Stanley financial advisers to recommend to clients. However, Phillips disregarded whether or not money managers had been vetted by Morgan Stanley before he recommended them to clients. He repeatedly failed to follow Morgan Stanleyâs policy that required its financial advisers to recommend at least three approved money managers to a client for each investment strategy. Instead, Phillips consistently recommended only a single unapproved manager for clients to select. Furthermore, advisory clients were not informed about the conflicts of interest that Morgan Stanley and Phillips had in recommending these unapproved money managers to clients. The firm and adviser had a financial incentive to recommend these unapproved managers based on the relationships that Phillips had cultivated with them. The SECâs order against Morgan Stanley finds that the firm violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act; failed reasonably to supervise Phillips; and failed to maintain certain books and records as required by Section 204 of the Advisers Act. Pursuant to the order, the Commission censured Morgan Stanley, ordered Morgan Stanley to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 204 and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and ordered Morgan Stanley to pay a penalty of $500,000. Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs findings, Morgan Stanley consented to the issuance of the Commissionâs order. In a separate proceeding that continues against Phillips, the SECâs Division of Enforcement alleges that Phillips aided and abetted and/or caused Morgan Stanleyâs violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

525,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a trader located in Kuwait and three related foreign entities for engaging in an illicit scheme through which they reaped millions of dollars in profits when trading around hoax offers to acquire U.S. companies. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order to freeze more than $5 million in trading profits located in various U.S. accounts in their names. The SEC filed its charges and obtained the asset freeze within days of the latest hoax offer. The SEC alleges that Hazem Khalid Al-Braikan and the related entities traded around false news of a purported tender offer by a Middle East investment group to acquire Harman International Industries. A phony announcement publicizing the hoax offer was faxed to media outlets on Sunday, July 19, and subsequently reported on the Internet. Harman's share price climbed more than 40 percent in pre-market trading on Monday, July 20. The SEC further alleges that two of the entities similarly traded around a hoax tender offer in April 2009, when a Kuwaiti newspaper reported that a consortium of Middle East companies were offering to purchase Textron Inc. This offer also turned out to be false. Al-Braikan and the entities amassed positions in securities of a company shortly before a bogus offer was publicized. They then sold their securities at prices inflated by the false information to reap their illicit profits. ""This case exemplifies the SEC's swift and surgical investigative skills and our determination to follow the trail wherever it leads,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Al-Braikan traded in an account in his own name and has been associated with each of the three entities that also traded: United Gulf Bank (B.S.C.); KIPCO Asset Management Company (KAMCO); and Al-Raya Investment Company. Upon the SEC's request, the Honorable John G. Koeltl issued a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' assets.

526,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Bank of America Corporation for misleading investors about billions of dollars in bonuses that were being paid to Merrill Lynch & Co. executives at the time of its acquisition of the firm. Bank of America agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a penalty of $33 million. The SEC alleges that in proxy materials soliciting the votes of shareholders on the proposed acquisition of Merrill, Bank of America stated that Merrill had agreed that it would not pay year-end performance bonuses or other discretionary compensation to its executives prior to the closing of the merger without Bank of America's consent. In fact, Bank of America had already contractually authorized Merrill to pay up to $5.8 billion in discretionary bonuses to Merrill executives for 2008. According to the SEC's complaint, the disclosures in the proxy statement were rendered materially false and misleading by the existence of the prior undisclosed agreement allowing Merrill to pay billions of dollars in bonuses for 2008. ""Companies must give shareholders all material information about corporate transactions they are asked to approve,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Failing to disclose that a struggling company will pay out billions of dollars in performance bonuses obviously violates that duty and warrants the significant financial penalty imposed by today's settlement."" David Rosenfeld, Associate Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said, ""As Merrill was on the brink of bankruptcy and posting record losses, Bank of America agreed to allow Merrill to pay its executives billions of dollars in bonuses. Shareholders were not told about this agreement at the time they voted on the merger."" The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Bank of America represented in the merger agreement that Merrill had agreed not to pay any bonuses to its executives before the merger closed, except as set forth in a schedule. Unbeknownst to shareholders, the schedule was already in place weeks before the proxy statement was filed with the SEC and disseminated to shareholders. Under the schedule, Bank of America had agreed that Merrill could pay up to $5.8 billion, or nearly 12 percent of the $50 billion merger consideration, in discretionary bonuses to its executives. The merger agreement was included as an appendix and summarized in the joint proxy statement that was distributed to all 283,000 shareholders of both companies. But Bank of America's agreement to allow Merrill to pay these discretionary bonuses was in a separate document that was omitted from the proxy statement and whose contents were never disclosed before the shareholders' vote on the merger. In settling the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Bank of America consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Bank of America from violating the proxy solicitation rules â Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 â and orders Bank of America to pay the financial penalty.

527,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud and other charges against General Electric Company (GE), alleging that it misled investors by reporting materially false and misleading results in its financial statements. The SEC alleges that GE used improper accounting methods to increase its reported earnings or revenues and avoid reporting negative financial results. GE has agreed to pay a $50 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges. ""GE bent the accounting rules beyond the breaking point,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Overly aggressive accounting can distort a company's true financial condition and mislead investors."" David P. Bergers, Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, added, ""Every accounting decision at a company should be driven by a desire to get it right, not to achieve a particular business objective. GE misapplied the accounting rules to cast its financial results in a better light."" The SEC uncovered the accounting violations in a risk-based investigation of GE's accounting practices. In a risk-based investigation, the SEC identifies a potential risk in an industry or at a particular issuer and develops an investigative plan to test whether the problem actually exists. In this case, the SEC identified the potential misuse of hedge accounting as a possible risk area. The SEC's investigation ultimately uncovered four separate accounting violations, and GE corrected the last of the violations in 2008. The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that GE met or exceeded final consensus analyst earnings per share (EPS) expectations every quarter from 1995 through filing of its 2004 annual report. However, on four separate occasions in 2002 and 2003, high-level GE accounting executives or other finance personnel approved accounting that was not in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In one instance, the improper accounting allowed GE to avoid missing analysts' final consensus EPS expectations. The four accounting violations were: Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GE agreed to the financial penalty and consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.

528,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today took its first enforcement actions for violations of the Commission's rules to prevent abusive ""naked"" short selling, charging two options traders and their broker-dealers with violating the locate and close-out requirements of Regulation SHO. The Commission also charged a supervisor at one of the firms. Regulation SHO requires broker-dealers to locate a source of borrowable shares prior to selling short, and to deliver securities sold short by a specified date. The SEC alleges that the traders and their firms improperly claimed that they were entitled to an exception to the locate requirement, and engaged in transactions that created the appearance that they were complying with the close-out requirement. In fact, they were not entitled to the exception and were not complying with the close-out requirement. The SEC charged New York City-based Hazan Capital Management LLC (HCM) and its principal trader and majority owner, Steven M. Hazan, with Regulation SHO violations, and separately charged Chicago-based TJM Proprietary Trading LLC and one of its traders, Michael R. Benson, with Regulation SHO violations while also charging TJM's chief operating officer John T. Burke for failing to supervise Benson. The firms and individuals agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the findings. ""These traders and their firms engaged in short selling tactics that circumvented regulatory requirements through complex options transactions,"" said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement and Special Advisor to the Director. ""Not only did these traders violate short selling rules, but the type of transactions they engaged in caused other market participants to effectively 'naked' short,"" added Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""HCM essentially loaned large amounts of hard-to-borrow stock to broker-dealers, who then provided locates on those shares to their institutional customers for short selling, which they otherwise might not have been able to do."" In the HCM proceeding, the Commission found that HCM engaged in misconduct from January 2005 to October 2007 and received ill-gotten gains of at least $3 million. The Commission ordered HCM to cease and desist from committing or causing, and Hazan to cease and desist from causing, any violations and future violations of Rules 203(b)(1) and 203(b)(3), censured HCM, and barred Hazan from association with any broker-dealer, with the right to reapply for association after five years. The Commission also ordered HCM and Hazan to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3 million, but provided that the payment obligation shall be deemed satisfied by orders of NYSE Amex, LLC and NYSE Arca, Inc. in their related actions directing Hazan and HCM to pay disgorgement in that amount. The Commission acknowledged HCM's and Hazan's undertakings to pay fines totaling $1 million in the related SRO actions. In the TJM proceeding, the Commission found that TJM engaged in misconduct from January 2007 to July 2007 and ordered TJM to cease and desist from committing or causing, and Benson to cease and desist from causing, any violations and any future violations of Rules 203(b)(1) and 203(b)(3). The Commission also censured TJM, suspended Benson from associating with any broker or dealer for a period of three months, and suspended Burke from acting in a supervisory capacity with a broker or dealer for a period of nine months. The Commission ordered TJM to pay disgorgement in the amount of $541,000, but provided that the payment obligation shall be deemed satisfied by an order of the Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc.'s (CBOE) Business Conduct Committee (BCC) in a related action directing TJM to pay disgorgement in that amount. The Commission acknowledged TJM's, Benson's, and Burke's undertaking to pay, jointly and severally, a $250,000 fine to the CBOE's BCC in its related action. In its continuing effort to address short selling abuses, the SEC last week announced several regulatory actions to further protect investors and the markets from the negative effects of abusive ""naked"" short sales. The Commission made permanent a temporary rule implemented in 2008 to address concerns about ""fails to deliver,"" and the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis has since determined that the number of fails to deliver has declined significantly under the rule. Fails to deliver in all equity securities has decreased by approximately 57 percent since the fall of 2008, and the average daily number of threshold list securities has declined from a high of approximately 582 securities in July 2008 to 63 in March 2009. The SEC also is considering other proposed short selling restrictions.

529,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former American International Group Chairman and CEO Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg and former Vice Chairman and CFO Howard Smith for their involvement in numerous improper accounting transactions that inflated AIG's reported financial results between 2000 and 2005. The SEC alleges that Greenberg and Smith are liable as control persons for AIG's violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws. Smith also is charged with direct violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws. The SEC alleges that Greenberg and Smith were responsible for material misstatements that enabled AIG to create the false impression that the company consistently met or exceeded key earnings and growth targets. According to the SEC's complaint, Greenberg publicly described AIG as the leader in the insurance and financial services industry with a history of delivering consistent double-digit growth. However, AIG faced numerous financial challenges under Greenberg's leadership that were disguised through improper accounting. Greenberg and Smith agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay disgorgement and penalties totaling $15 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The SEC previously charged AIG in 2006 with securities fraud and improper accounting, and the company settled the charges by paying disgorgement of $700 million and a penalty of $100 million, among other remedies. ""Corporate leaders cannot avoid the truth and consequences of their companies' performance by using improper accounting gimmicks and signing off on distorted financial reports,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Greenberg and Smith oversaw various improper transactions that presented a false financial picture and allowed AIG to claim success in meeting its performance goals."" Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of the Commission's New York Regional Office, added, ""Executives who are responsible for financial reporting and controls will be held accountable when they or their companies orchestrate fraudulent transactions to polish results and mask the truth from investors."" The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the defendants with responsibility for the following improper accounting transactions: Sham reinsurance transactions to make it appear that AIG had legitimately increased its general loss reserves. A purported deal with an offshore shell entity to conceal multi-million dollar underwriting losses from AIG's auto-warranty insurance business. Economically senseless round-trip transactions to report improper gains in investment income. The purported sale of tax exempt municipal bonds owned by AIG's subsidiaries to trusts that AIG controlled in order to improperly recognize realized capital gains. The SEC's complaint alleges that Greenberg knew about the effects that certain improper transactions would have on AIG's reported financial results, and along with Smith was responsible for false and misleading public statements and material omissions in quarterly reports that AIG filed in the second and third quarters of 2002, and in related press releases and investor conference calls. In 2005, AIG restated its prior accounting for many transactions, including those that are the subject of the charges in the SEC's complaint. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Greenberg has consented to a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, and from controlling any person who violates the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and directing him to pay a penalty of $7.5 million and disgorgement of $7.5 million. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith has consented to a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud and other provision of the securities laws, and from controlling any person who violates the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions, directing him to pay a penalty of $750,000 and disgorgement of $750,000, and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company for three years.

531,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Bernard L. Madoff's chief financial officer, Frank DiPascali, with securities fraud for overseeing the mechanics of Madoff's entirely fictitious investment strategy and creating millions of phony documents and trading records to conceal the fraud from regulators and investors. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, DiPascali helped generate bogus annual returns of 10 to 17 percent by fabricating backdated and fictitious trades that never occurred. The SEC further alleges that DiPascali helped Madoff cover up the fraud by preparing fake trade blotters, stock records, customer confirmations, Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate the non-existent trading. ""DiPascali and Madoff ran an extraordinary and massive counterfeiting operation that concealed their fraud from investors and regulators alike,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's complaint, DiPascali has consented to a proposed partial judgment, which if entered by the court would impose a permanent injunction against DiPascali and leave the issues of disgorgement and a financial penalty to be decided at a later time. The SEC alleges that DiPascali, who resides in Bridgewater, N.J., sustained Madoff's unprecedented fraud from at least the 1980s until the scheme's collapse, causing billions of dollars in investor losses. A specific computer was used to simulate phantom trading in advisory accounts, and to generate phony books and records reflecting that trading. This fake set of books and records was kept separate and distinct from the books and records for the market-making and proprietary trading operation at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS). When investors sent in funds to BMIS for investment, the funds were deposited or wired into a bank account at JPMorgan Chase that was not in any way reflected on the books and records (including the ledger) of the BMIS broker-dealer operation. The SEC's complaint alleges that great effort was made to hide the fact that there were several thousand advisory accounts at BMIS, which would have required SEC registration. DiPascali helped Madoff devise a shifting subset of 10 to 25 accounts â known as the ""special"" accounts â which they deceptively presented as the universe of BMIS advisory accounts. DiPascali and others prepared fake books and records to provide regulators with information about only these special accounts in order to conceal the true size of the advisory business. According to the SEC's complaint, DiPascali joined BMIS as a research clerk at age 19 after dropping out of college. Eventually, Madoff put DiPascali in charge of the bulk of day-to-day operations on the now-infamous 17th floor of BMIS. As Madoff consistently communicated his fear of detection to DiPascali, a significant portion of DiPascali's time and effort was dedicated to anticipating and preparing for regulatory inquiries â particularly SEC examinations in 2004 and 2005 and an SEC investigation in 2006. The SEC's complaint alleges that DiPascali helped carry out Madoff's fictitious ""split-strike conversion"" strategy that BMIS claimed to be pursuing on behalf of its clients. DiPascali helped Madoff structure and record non-existent trades that were reflected on millions of pages of customer confirmations and account statements distributed each year. None of the trades purportedly executed as part of this strategy ever occurred. In fact, the strategy was nothing more than fictitious trading by hindsight, supported by documents created after the fact based on actual historical data. According to the SEC's complaint, DiPascali helped Madoff cover his tracks in numerous nefarious ways. For instance, when Madoff grew concerned that showing positive returns every month would be suspicious, he occasionally instructed DiPascali to enter phony trades designed to lose money in order to make their investment strategy and returns more credible. In order to avoid scrutiny by sophisticated financial institutions, they made a practice of closing down accounts of investors who worked at such institutions. Madoff and DiPascali even went so far as to develop a phantom computer trading platform that would appear to reflect real trading. In the event of a surprise visit from outsiders requesting to observe real-time trading activity, one BMIS employee was to enter trades on a computer screen and another employee was to go into an office nearby and play the role of a counterparty trader in Europe. The SEC further alleges that DiPascali misappropriated investor funds for personal gain, setting up an account at BMIS for himself in 2002 that he named after his fishing yacht, Dorothy Jo. DiPascali withdrew more than $5 million from the account between 2002 and 2008 to fund personal expenses, including the purchase of a new boat. DiPascali's withdrawals were funded directly from money deposited by investors with BMIS. Investor money being used to fund the overall operations of BMIS also contributed to the more than $2 million in salary and bonus that DiPascali received each year. Today's charges mark the fifth enforcement action taken by the SEC related to the Madoff fraud. Previously, the Commission charged Madoff and BMIS, their auditors, certain solicitors, and certain feeder funds. The Commission's complaint specifically alleges that DiPascali violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; violated, and aided and abetted violations of, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder and Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring DiPascali to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Commission's investigation is continuing.

532,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Brooklyn money manager for running a $40 million Ponzi scheme in which he promised approximately 800 investors guaranteed high returns from safe, liquid investments, but instead spent their money on real estate, his pornography mail order business, and other interests. The SEC alleges that Philip G. Barry and his firms Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services defrauded investors, including senior citizens and retirees, by selling securities in Leverage investment funds. According to the Commission's complaint, Barry provided fake account statements to investors that recorded growing account balances and concealed that Barry had not been trading securities at all for several years. Neither Barry nor any of his related firms is registered with the SEC in any capacity. ""Barry was an unscrupulous and unregulated investment manager who lured victims with false promises of investment safety, lofty performance, and liquidity,"" said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""While Barry guaranteed investors high returns and provided them with false account balances, he was secretly diverting the funds into unauthorized ventures and for his personal use."" The SEC alleges that Barry and his firms made numerous and varied misrepresentations to induce investors to invest in or to maintain their investments with the Leverage investment funds. For example, Barry falsely represented that he would use the investors' funds to trade in options or other securities. In addition, Barry falsely told investors that he would use a proven trading strategy to protect investors' principal and generate guaranteed returns of as much as 21 percent per year. As alleged in the complaint, these purportedly guaranteed rates of return were simply numbers arbitrarily selected by Barry. Barry also misrepresented to some investors that their investments in Leverage would be protected from loss by privately obtained insurance and/or by the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC). Barry told investors that they could liquidate their investment at any time and withdraw their funds, after providing Leverage with a few weeks notice. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, by approximately 1999, Barry had ceased investing any of his investors' funds in options or other securities. Instead, the Commission alleges that Barry ran a Ponzi scheme in which he used incoming investor money to repay other existing investors and diverted the remaining investor funds for his own personal use. According to the Commission's complaint, Barry spent the money by purchasing real estate in his own name and those of other entities he controlled, paying expenses of a separate mail order business that sold pornographic materials, and supporting his lifestyle. The SEC's complaint charges Barry, Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against all defendants. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Barry, Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services agreed to settle the SEC's claims against them and consented to the entry of a judgment, subject to approval by the court, that enjoins them from future violations of the above provisions of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, the amounts of which will be determined at a later date. Barry also has consented to the issuance of a Commission order barring him from association with an investment adviser. Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York (USAO) today announced criminal charges against Barry for the same misconduct alleged in the SEC's complaint.

533,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Richardson, Texas resident Reza Saleh with insider trading around the public announcement of Dell Inc.'s tender offer for Perot Systems earlier this week. The SEC alleges that Saleh made increasingly large purchases of Perot Systems call options contracts based on material, non-public information that he learned in the course of his employment with, or duties for, two Perot-related private companies and Perot Systems. Immediately following the tender offer announcement on Monday, September 21, Saleh sold all of the call option contracts in the accounts and reaped approximately $8.6 million in illicit profits. Later that same morning, SEC staff with assistance from the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority identified Saleh as a suspicious trader. Soon after being contacted by SEC staff, Saleh acknowledged to a Perot Systems director that he knew about the impending transaction when he traded. ""The overwhelming evidence in this case allowed the SEC to move quickly against the trader before he could spend the huge profits from his illegal trading,"" said Rose Romero, Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. ""The Commission is seeking a court order to freeze Saleh's assets."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Saleh purchased 9,332 Perot Systems call option contracts through two brokerage accounts between Sept. 4 and Sept. 18, 2009. The call option contracts were set to expire in October 2009 and January 2010. Saleh sold all of the call options following the announcement as Perot Systems' stock price immediately increased by approximately 65 percent. The SEC's complaint charges that Saleh violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including specific provisions that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information about tender offers. In addition to seeking an emergency asset freeze, the SEC has sought a preliminary injunction and a final judgment permanently enjoining Saleh from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The SEC's complaint also names Amir Saleh of Richardson, Texas, as a relief defendant, in order to recover trading profits he received as a co-account holder on one of Reza Saleh's brokerage accounts. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

534,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Detroit-area stock broker Frank Bluestein with fraud, alleging that he lured elderly investors into a $250 million Ponzi scheme after convincing many of them to refinance their home mortgages. The SEC alleges that Bluestein acted as the single largest salesperson in the Ponzi scheme operated by Edward May and his company, E-M Management Company LLC (E-M). The SEC previously filed charges against May and E-M in connection with the fraudulent scheme. The SEC alleges that Bluestein specifically targeted potential investors who were retired or elderly and conducted so-called âinvestment seminarsâ in Michigan and California to lure them into investing in E-M securities. âBluestein convinced elderly investors to refinance their homes to invest in securities that he falsely claimed were safe,â said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the SECâs Chicago Regional Office. âHis lies, false assurances, and unscrupulous tactics put many investors at risk of losing not only their life savings, but also their homes.â The SECâs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that Bluestein facilitated Mayâs fraudulent scheme by raising approximately $74 million from more than 800 investors through the sale of E-M securities over a five-year period. Bluestein, through his company Maximum Financial, conducted numerous investment seminars to find new E-M investors. According to the SECâs complaint, Bluestein was very methodical and careful not to discuss the E-M offerings openly during these âseminarsâ in a way that would alert attendees to the fact that they were actually forums to pitch the E-M offerings. Bluestein first gained the trust of potential investors in attendance by discussing generic financial planning topics and other investment products. But under the guise of informal conversations, Bluestein would generate talks among attendees who already had invested in E-M offerings. For instance, Bluestein would often ask if they had âreceived their Ed May checks?â or âHow do you like those Ed Mays?â in order to drum up discussion of the investments and attract the interest of other potential investors attending the seminars. The SECâs complaint alleges that Bluestein misrepresented to investors that the investments were low-risk and that he had conducted adequate due diligence with respect to the investments when, in fact, he did little to investigate the legitimacy of the E-M offerings even when confronted with serious red flags about the existence of some transactions. Bluestein also misled investors about the compensation he was receiving from the offerings by failing to disclose that he received at least $2.4 million in commissions from May and E-M in addition to the $1.4 million in disclosed compensation he received from investor funds. The SEC complaint alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by Bluestein. As part of this action, the SEC seeks an order of permanent injunction against Bluestein as well as the payment of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and financial penalties.

548,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chief financial officer of a San Francisco private investment firm and six of his relatives and friends with insider trading, alleging that their scheme collectively reaped more than $8 million in illicit profits from unlawful trades in the securities of Tempur-pedic International, Inc. and Acxiom Corporation. The SEC alleges that Chen Tang of Fremont, Calif., learned non-public information as the CFO of a private equity fund and from illegal tips by his brother-in-law, who was the CFO of a venture capital fund. Tang and his trading partners, which included his brother and four friends, traded on the inside information through their personal brokerage and retirement accounts, the accounts of their spouses, children and relatives, and the accounts of several privately-offered investment funds that Tang and three of his friends managed. ""As the CFO of a private equity firm, Tang was entrusted with highly confidential and material information, and he violated that trust by misusing the information to generate enormous illegal profits,"" said Rose Romero, Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Tang learned confidential information in 2008 about an impending surprise pre-announcement that Tempur would not meet its earnings forecast. Tang illegally tipped the information to three of his friends â Joseph Seto of San Francisco, Ming Siu of Hayward, Calif., and Zisen Yu of Fremont. Tang and his friends began establishing short positions in Tempur securities and purchasing put option contracts that would only be profitable to the traders if Tempur's stock price declined. When Tempur made its pre-announcement, its stock price declined 37 percent and the traders closed all their short positions, garnering illegal profits of approximately $1.2 million. The SEC alleges that Tang also became aware of plans by his firm to make a large, market-moving purchase of Tempur securities in the days following the pre-announcement. Based on this inside information, Tang and his friends purchased Tempur securities just before and during the transaction. On the same day that the firm completed its acquisitions of Tempur stock, Tang and his trading partners began selling their Tempur stock holdings. During the two-day period of the firm's stock purchases, Tempur's stock price increased approximately 18 percent. When they closed their positions, Tang and his friends obtained illegal profits of more than $800,000. During all relevant periods and at the time he traded, Tang was under express instructions from his firm not to trade Tempur securities. The SEC also alleges that Tang separately received illegal trading tips in 2007 from his brother-in-law Ronald Yee, who also lives in Fremont. In his role as CFO at a venture capital fund, Yee learned that his firm planned to submit a bid to acquire Acxiom. Months later, after Acxiom and his firm had publicly announced a merger agreement, Yee learned that the deal was in jeopardy. As soon as Yee learned about each of these matters, in breach of his duties to the firm, he passed material, non-public information to Tang. Tang then tipped Seto, Siu and Yu as well as his brother James Tang of San Gabriel, Calif., and Yee's brother Eddie Yu of Fremont. According to the SEC's complaint, Yee did not make any trades himself. But Tang and each of the others bought Acxiom securities based on Yee's initial tip about his firm's bid, and some of them took short positions in Acxiom based on the later tip that the deal was in jeopardy. Collectively, they realized profits of more than $6 million from their insider trading in Acxiom securities.

549,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chief financial officer of a San Francisco private investment firm and six of his relatives and friends with insider trading, alleging that their scheme collectively reaped more than $8 million in illicit profits from unlawful trades in the securities of Tempur-pedic International, Inc. and Acxiom Corporation. The SEC alleges that Chen Tang of Fremont, Calif., learned non-public information as the CFO of a private equity fund and from illegal tips by his brother-in-law, who was the CFO of a venture capital fund. Tang and his trading partners, which included his brother and four friends, traded on the inside information through their personal brokerage and retirement accounts, the accounts of their spouses, children and relatives, and the accounts of several privately-offered investment funds that Tang and three of his friends managed. ""As the CFO of a private equity firm, Tang was entrusted with highly confidential and material information, and he violated that trust by misusing the information to generate enormous illegal profits,"" said Rose Romero, Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Tang learned confidential information in 2008 about an impending surprise pre-announcement that Tempur would not meet its earnings forecast. Tang illegally tipped the information to three of his friends â Joseph Seto of San Francisco, Ming Siu of Hayward, Calif., and Zisen Yu of Fremont. Tang and his friends began establishing short positions in Tempur securities and purchasing put option contracts that would only be profitable to the traders if Tempur's stock price declined. When Tempur made its pre-announcement, its stock price declined 37 percent and the traders closed all their short positions, garnering illegal profits of approximately $1.2 million. The SEC alleges that Tang also became aware of plans by his firm to make a large, market-moving purchase of Tempur securities in the days following the pre-announcement. Based on this inside information, Tang and his friends purchased Tempur securities just before and during the transaction. On the same day that the firm completed its acquisitions of Tempur stock, Tang and his trading partners began selling their Tempur stock holdings. During the two-day period of the firm's stock purchases, Tempur's stock price increased approximately 18 percent. When they closed their positions, Tang and his friends obtained illegal profits of more than $800,000. During all relevant periods and at the time he traded, Tang was under express instructions from his firm not to trade Tempur securities. The SEC also alleges that Tang separately received illegal trading tips in 2007 from his brother-in-law Ronald Yee, who also lives in Fremont. In his role as CFO at a venture capital fund, Yee learned that his firm planned to submit a bid to acquire Acxiom. Months later, after Acxiom and his firm had publicly announced a merger agreement, Yee learned that the deal was in jeopardy. As soon as Yee learned about each of these matters, in breach of his duties to the firm, he passed material, non-public information to Tang. Tang then tipped Seto, Siu and Yu as well as his brother James Tang of San Gabriel, Calif., and Yee's brother Eddie Yu of Fremont. According to the SEC's complaint, Yee did not make any trades himself. But Tang and each of the others bought Acxiom securities based on Yee's initial tip about his firm's bid, and some of them took short positions in Acxiom based on the later tip that the deal was in jeopardy. Collectively, they realized profits of more than $6 million from their insider trading in Acxiom securities. The SEC has charged the seven defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

555,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a pair of lawyers for tipping inside information in exchange for kickbacks as well as six Wall Street traders and a proprietary trading firm involved in a $20 million insider trading scheme. The SEC alleges that Arthur J. Cutillo, an attorney in the New York office of international law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, had access to confidential information about at least four major proposed corporate transactions in which his firm's clients participated. Through his friend and fellow attorney Jason Goldfarb, Cutillo tipped this inside information to Zvi Goffer, a proprietary trader at New York-based firm Schottenfeld Group. Goffer promptly tipped four traders at three different broker-dealer firms and another professional trader Craig Drimal, who each then traded either for their own account or their firm's proprietary accounts. Goffer was known as ""the Octopussy"" within the insider trading ring due to his reputation for having his arms in so many sources of inside information. Cutillo, Goldfarb, and Goffer at times used disposable cell phones in an attempt to conceal the scheme. For example, prior to the announcement of one acquisition, Goffer gave one of his tippees a disposable cell phone that had two programmed phone numbers labeled ""you"" and ""me."" After the announcement, Goffer destroyed the disposable cell phone by removing the SIM card, biting it, and breaking the phone in half, throwing away half of the phone and instructing his tippee to dispose of the other half.

Friestad, Associate Director in the SEC's Enforcement Division, added, ""Today's action highlights the apparent ease with which far too many lawyers, hedge funds and Wall Street traders are willing to break the law to obtain a bag of cash, a trading advantage or other perceived benefit. It is fundamentally unfair for these individuals to profit at the expense of honest investors and compromise the integrity of our markets."" The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges in addition to Cutillo, Goldfarb, Goffer and Drimal: Schottenfeld Group LLC Emanuel Goffer of New York, N.Y. â formerly a registered representative at the broker-dealer Spectrum Trading LLC, and currently associated with the broker-dealer Echotrade. Michael A. Kimelman of Larchmont, N.Y. â formerly a trader at Lighthouse Financial Group LLC, an investment bank and broker-dealer, and currently a registered representative at Echotrade.

556,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chief financial officer of a New York-based hedge fund with securities fraud for arranging secret sales of securities from his personal trading account to the hedge fund accounts at inflated prices to generate his own illicit profits. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ezra C. Levy's job responsibilities at investment advisory firm Boston Provident LP required that he have access to the firm's electronic trade entry system. He did not, however, have the authority to make trading decisions for Boston Provident's accounts, and was merely authorized to execute the trading decisions of the firm's chief executive officer. The SEC alleges that Levy made unauthorized, fraudulent trades that resulted in financial losses to the hedge fund accounts while he made a personal profit of more than a half-million dollars. The SEC is seeking a court order to freeze Levy's assets. ""Levy executed a fraudulent scheme to benefit himself at the expense of Boston Provident and its clients,"" said Andrew Calamari, Associate Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""Levy clearly violated the trust placed in him by putting his own selfish priorities ahead of investors and the securities laws."" The SEC alleges that on two days in June 2009, Levy secretly entered ""sell"" orders for securities at above-market prices for his personal account. At approximately the same time, he entered ""buy"" orders for Boston Provident's accounts, for the same securities at the same above-market prices. By placing these matched orders, Levy caused sales of securities from his personal account to Boston Provident's accounts at inflated prices. Levy's profit from these fraudulent trades exceeded $537,000. The SEC's complaint alleges that Levy violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

557,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two computer programmers for their role in helping convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard L. Madoff cover up the fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) for more than 15 years. The SEC alleges that Jerome O'Hara of Malverne, N.Y., and George Perez of East Brunswick, N.J., provided the technical support necessary to produce false documents and trading records, and took hush money to help keep the scheme going. ""Without the help of O'Hara and Perez, the Madoff fraud would not have been possible,"" said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""They used their special computer skills to create sophisticated, credible and entirely phony trading records that were critical to the success of Madoff's scheme for so many years."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Madoff and his lieutenant Frank DiPascali, Jr., routinely asked O'Hara and Perez for their help in creating records that, among other things, combined actual positions and activity from BMIS' market-making and proprietary trading businesses with the fictional balances maintained in investor accounts. O'Hara and Perez wrote programs that generated many thousands of pages of fake trade blotters, stock records, Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate nonexistent trading. They assigned file names to many of these programs that began with ""SPCL,"" which is short for ""special."" A separate computer internally known as ""House 17"" was used to process BMIS investment advisory account data at the direction of Madoff, DiPascali and others. The SEC alleges that O'Hara and Perez knew that the House 17 computer was missing a host of functioning programs necessary for actual securities trading and reporting. According to the SEC's complaint, they recognized that the trades being entered into House 17 and the account statements and trade confirmations being sent to investors did not reflect actual trades. The SEC alleges that O'Hara and Perez had a crisis of conscience in 2006 and tried to cover their tracks by attempting to delete approximately 218 of the 225 special programs from the House 17 computer. But they did not delete the monthly backup tapes. O'Hara and Perez then cashed out hundreds of thousands of dollars each from their personal BMIS accounts before confronting Madoff and refusing to generate any more fabricated books and records. According to O'Hara's handwritten notes from the encounter, one of them told Madoff, ""I won't lie any longer. Next time, I say 'ask Frank,'"" meaning that Madoff should rely on DiPascali alone to create the false data and reports. The SEC's complaint alleges that Madoff responded by telling DiPascali to offer O'Hara and Perez as much money as necessary to keep quiet and not expose the misrepresentations. O'Hara and Perez considered the offer and demanded a salary increase of nearly 25 percent along with one-time bonuses in late 2006 of more than $60,000 each. They stated to DiPascali at the time that they did not ask for more because a greater amount might appear too suspicious. DiPascali then managed to convince O'Hara and Perez to modify computer programs so that he and other 17th floor employees could create the necessary reports themselves. This is the SEC's latest enforcement action concerning the Madoff fraud since the scheme collapsed last December. The Commission previously charged Madoff and BMIS, DiPascali, and auditors David G. Friehling and Friehling & Horowitz CPAs, P.C.. The SEC also charged certain feeders with committing securities fraud through a Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of BMIS. Madoff, DiPascali and Friehling have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to their conduct. The SEC's complaint specifically alleges that O'Hara and Perez aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 10b-5 and 17a-3 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring O'Hara and Perez to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.

558,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former top officers of New Century Financial Corporation with securities fraud for misleading investors as New Century's subprime mortgage business was collapsing in 2006. At the time of the fraud, New Century was one of the largest subprime lenders in the nation. ""New Century shareholders took a double-hit: the company's mortgage assets and business performance became increasingly impaired, and management manipulated its numbers and concealed its deteriorating performance,"" said Robert Khuzami, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. The SEC is devoting significant resources to identifying and holding accountable those who committed fraud in the subprime industry. Previous mortgage-related SEC enforcement actions include securities fraud charges against Countrywide Financial CEO Angelo Mozilo, and senior executives, including the CEO, of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. In the case of New Century, the SEC's complaint names as defendants: In its complaint, the SEC alleges that New Century disclosures generally sought to assure investors that its business was not at risk and was performing better than its peers. Defendants, however, failed to disclose important negative information, including dramatic increases in early loan defaults, loan repurchases, and pending loan repurchase requests. Defendants knew this negative information from numerous internal reports they regularly received, including weekly reports that Morrice ominously entitled ""Storm Watch."" The complaint also alleges that Dodge and Kenneally fraudulently accounted for expenses related to bad loans that it had to repurchase. In the face of dramatically increasing loan repurchases and a huge, undisclosed backlog of repurchase demands, Kenneally, with Dodge's knowledge, made changes to New Century's accounting for loan repurchases in both the second and third quarters of 2006. These undisclosed accounting changes violated generally accepted accounting principles and resulted in New Century's improperly avoiding substantial repurchase expenses and materially overstating its financial results. The complaint further alleges that the defendants' fraud caused investors substantial losses. From early 2006 to early 2007, New Century's stock price ranged from $30.00 to $50.00; and in the second half of 2006, the company raised $142.5 million by selling stock to new investors. After New Century announced in February 2007 that it would have restate its 2006 financial statements, New Century's stock price fell 36% to around $19.00. New Century's stock price continued to fall, and traded at less than $1 when the company filed for bankruptcy in April 2007. The complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, officer and director bars, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks from Morrice and Dodge reimbursement of bonuses and incentive or equity-based compensation pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

559,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an additional attorney who worked at international law firm Ropes & Gray LLP in the agency's ongoing investigation into a $20 million insider trading ring involving Wall Street traders, lawyers, and hedge fund managers. The SEC alleges that Brien P. Santarlas of Hoboken, N.J., tipped material nonpublic information about confidential proposed corporate acquisitions by firm clients to a network of others in exchange for kickbacks. Santarlas worked with another former attorney in Ropes & Gray's New York office, Arthur J. Cutillo, to access and misappropriate the confidential information. The SEC last month charged Cutillo and eight others with insider trading. ""Gatekeepers serve a critical role advising participants in the capital markets. When lawyers who have access to nonpublic information betray client confidences, it both tarnishes the profession and undermines investor faith in the marketplace,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Cutillo and Santarlas tipped material, nonpublic information to Zvi Goffer, through Jason Goldfarb, concerning two proposed corporate acquisitions or bids in which Ropes & Gray represented certain acquirers: The SEC alleges that the downstream tippees of Santarlas and Cutillo who traded on these two deals made approximately $20 million in illegal profits. The SEC's complaint charges Santarlas with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

561,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former employees at major global financial institutions and two of their friends in a serial insider trading scheme to profit on highly confidential merger and acquisition information. The SEC alleges that Vinayak S. Gowrish, a former associate at multi-billion dollar private equity firm TPG Capital L.P., and Adnan S. Zaman, a former vice president and investment banker at Lazard FrÃ¨res & Co. LLC, stole confidential information from their firms in connection with five deals and tipped two friends in exchange for kickbacks. Pascal S. Vaghar and Sameer N. Khoury both then traded stock and options on the basis of the nonpublic information and made nearly $500,000 in illicit profits. According to the SEC's complaint in the case, the illegal tips, trades, and kickback payments were structured to avoid detection. They exchanged illegal tips through coded text messages and yellow sticky notes. Vaghar often wrote checks made payable to himself or cash rather than to Gowrish or Zaman directly so as not to create a paper trail. Vaghar also gave his credit card to Zaman so he could charge purchases of personal items in stores and on the Internet for himself in Vaghar's name. They also attempted to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny to their illegal activities by deliberately trading relatively small amounts of the targeted securities. ""Confidential deal information is not just another commodity that can be traded for profit,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""These financial professionals betrayed their firms and clients to make some easy money with their friends, and they tried to cover their tracks to no avail."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Gowrish misappropriated and illegally tipped material, nonpublic information that TPG was in negotiations to acquire Sabre Holdings Corp., TXU Corp., and Alliance Data Systems Corp. Gowrish illegally tipped this information to Zaman, who then tipped the inside information to Vaghar and Khoury. The SEC further alleges that Zaman misappropriated and illegally tipped material, nonpublic information that Lazard clients were in negotiations to acquire webMethods, Inc. and Myogen, Inc. Zaman tipped the information to Vaghar and Khoury through in-person meetings or by writing trading instructions â including the ticker symbol of the call option (or stock) and the number of contracts (or shares) to purchase â on yellow sticky notes. Coded text messages were used to exchange trading instructions. In exchange for the confidential information, Gowrish received cash kickbacks from Vaghar, and Zaman received kickbacks in the form of cash, free rent, and other items of value from Vaghar and Khoury totaling approximately $70,000. The SEC's complaint charges each of the four defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Zaman and Vaghar were also charged with violations of Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-3 thereunder in connection with tipping and trading on material, nonpublic information concerning a tender offer. Zaman, Vaghar, and Sameer Khoury have offered to settle to full injunctive relief and disgorgement, and Zaman has agreed to be permanently barred from associating with any broker or dealer.

563,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged General Re Corporation for its involvement in separate schemes by American International Group (AIG) and Prudential Financial, Inc. to manipulate and falsify their reported financial results. Gen Re agreed to pay $12.2 million to settle the SECâs charges. In addition, in a non-prosecution agreement announced today by the Department of Justice in connection with a related criminal investigation of Gen Reâs transactions with AIG, Gen Re agreed to pay $19.5 million to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Consumer Fraud Fund. Gen Re also agreed to pay $60.5 million through a civil class action settlement to AIGâs injured shareholders. Gen Re previously forfeited to the government approximately $5 million in fees it earned for its participation in the scheme with AIG. âGen Re arranged to sell financial products to AIG and Prudential for the sole purpose of enabling those companies to manipulate their accounting results and mislead investors,â said Andrew M. Calamari, Associate Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. The SEC previously charged AIG with securities fraud and improper accounting, and the company settled the charges by paying more than $800 million among other remedies. The SEC also previously charged AIG former chairman Maurice R. âHankâ Greenberg and former chief financial officer Howard I. Smith, as well as former senior executives of Gen Re for their roles in connection with the scheme with AIG. The Commission separately charged Prudential with securities laws violations in 2008. According to the SECâs complaint against Gen Re, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a foreign subsidiary of Gen Re entered into two sham âreinsuranceâ transactions with AIG in 2000 to improperly allow AIG to reverse the declining reserve trend and falsely report additions to both loss reserves and premiums written. Senior officials at Gen Re helped AIG structure the two sham transactions. The contracts show reinsurance transactions that appeared to transfer risk to AIG, but the transactions did not transfer risk. The SEC further alleges that Gen Re separately entered into a series of sham reinsurance contracts with Prudentialâs property and casualty division from 1997 to 2002. The contracts had no economic substance and purpose other than to allow Prudential to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset or âfinite bankâ parked with Gen Re. As a result of the sham transactions, Prudential improperly recognized more than $200 million in revenues in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Gen Re received fees totaling $8.1 million for structuring and executing the scheme with Prudential. In determining to accept Gen Reâs settlement offer, the SEC took Gen Reâs remediation efforts and cooperation into account. Among the efforts SEC considered: Gen Reâs comprehensive, independent review of its operations conducted at the outset of the governmentâs investigations the results of which were shared with investigators; Gen Reâs substantial assistance in the governmentâs successful civil and criminal actions against individuals involved in the scheme with AIG; and Gen Reâs internal corporate reforms designed to strengthen oversight of its operations. Those reforms entail dissolving a subsidiary involved with the AIG transactions, appointing an independent director to its Board of Directors, forming a committee consisting of senior managers to review and approve complex transactions, requiring legal review of proposed finite or loss mitigation contracts, and fortifying its internal audit functions and underwriting rules. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

564,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Boston-based State Street Bank and Trust Company with misleading its investors about their exposure to subprime investments while selectively disclosing more complete information to specific investors. State Street has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $300 million that will be distributed to investors who lost money during the subprime market meltdown in 2007. This payment is in addition to nearly $350 million that State Street previously agreed to pay to investors in State Street funds to settle private claims. ""State Street led investors to believe that their investments were more diversified than a typical money market portfolio, when instead they were invested almost entirely in subprime investments that ultimately caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Investigating potential securities law violations arising out of the credit crisis remains a high priority for the SEC Enforcement Division."" The enforcement action is the result of joint efforts by the SEC with the Massachusetts Securities Division and the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, which both announced related charges against State Street today. David P. Bergers, Director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, said, ""State Street informed certain investors and left others in the dark about their subprime mortgage exposure. This global settlement will ensure that harmed investors are compensated."" According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Boston and a related administrative order issued by the Commission, State Street established its Limited Duration Bond Fund in 2002 and marketed it as an ""enhanced cash"" investment strategy that was an alternative to a money market fund for certain types of investors. By 2007, however, the fund was almost entirely invested in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities and derivatives that magnified its exposure to subprime securities. But State Street continued to describe the fund to prospective and current investors as having better sector diversification than a typical money market fund, and failed to disclose the extent of the fund's concentration in subprime investments. According to the SEC's complaint and order, State Street sent investors a series of misleading communications beginning in July 2007 concerning the effect of the turmoil in the subprime market on the Limited Duration Bond Fund and other State Street funds that invested in it. At the same time, however, State Street provided particular investors with more complete information about the fund's subprime concentration and other problems with the fund. These other investors included clients of State Street's internal advisory groups, which provided advisory services to some investors in this fund and related funds. The SEC alleges that, based on this more complete information, State Street's internal advisory groups subsequently decided to recommend that all of their clients including the pension plan of State Street's publicly-traded parent company (State Street Corporation) redeem their investments from the fund and the related funds. The SEC alleges that State Street sold the fund's most liquid holdings and used the cash it received from these sales to meet the redemption demands of better informed investors, leaving the fund and its remaining investors with largely illiquid holdings. Under the terms of the settlement, State Street agreed to pay a $50 million penalty, more than $8.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and more than $255 million in additional payments to compensate investors. Combined with nearly $350 million that State Street has already paid or agreed to pay some investors through settlements of private lawsuits, the total compensation to harmed State Street investors is approximately $663 million. State Street also was ordered to cease and desist from any further violations of certain securities laws. The SEC's enforcement action took into account the company's remediation and its cooperation, including: The SEC's investigation is ongoing. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the offices of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F. Galvin and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley.

565,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged one of convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff's key operatives with falsifying accounting records to enable the multi-billion dollar fraud and illegally enrich himself, Madoff, and Madoff's family and employees. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Daniel Bonventre disguised Madoff's fraud and the financial losses at Madoff's firm by misusing and improperly recording investor money to create the false appearance of legitimate income. As Madoff's Director of Operations, Bonventre ran the back office at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) and oversaw the firm's accounting and securities clearing functions for at least 30 years. The SEC alleges that Bonventre knew that billions of dollars in investor funds were not being used to purchase securities on behalf of investors. The SEC further alleges that Bonventre made at least $1.9 million in illicit personal profits from the scheme through fake, backdated ""trades"" in his own investor account at BMIS. ""A fraud of this magnitude requires a coordinated effort. Bonventre played an essential part by creating bogus financial records to give BMIS the appearance of legitimacy, when in fact the firm lost money and could not have survived without the fraud,"" said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. According to the SEC's complaint, Bonventre was responsible for the firm's general ledger and financial statements that were materially misstated because they did not reflect the manner in which investor funds were maintained and used. Bonventure ensured that BMIS financial reports did not reflect the firm's massive liabilities to investors or the corresponding assets received from investors. To hide the fact that BMIS normally operated at a significant loss, the firm used more than $750 million in investor funds to artificially improve reported revenue and income. The SEC alleges that Bonventre also helped Madoff, his lieutenant Frank DiPascali, Jr., and others orchestrate lies to investors and regulators when investment advisory operations at BMIS came under review. With Bonventre's assistance, they made serial misrepresentations to external reviewers by manufacturing reams of false reports and data. The SEC further alleges that Bonventre personally siphoned $1.9 million from the scheme by directing that profits from fake, backdated trades be put into his own investor account at BMIS. One of these trades was backdated by 12 years. Bonventure instructed another fake, backdated trade in a handwritten note to a BMIS employee that read: ""Hi As per our phone conversation, I need a long term capital gain of $449000.â on an investment of $129000- for a sale proceed of $578000.â I'll be back in NY on March 30th but if you need to speak to me before then, call me . Thanks[,] Dan."" This is the SEC's seventh enforcement action in the Madoff fraud since the scheme collapsed in December 2008. The Commission previously charged Madoff and BMIS, DiPascali, and auditors David G. Friehling and Friehling & Horowitz CPAs, P.C., who have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to their conduct. The SEC also charged certain feeder funds with committing securities fraud, and charged two computer programmers at Madoff's firm for their roles in covering up the scheme. The SEC's complaint specifically alleges that Bonventre violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 17a-3, and 17a-5 thereunder, and Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring Bonventre to disgorge his ill-gotten gains.

566,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a prominent Miami-based business leader and his wife with fraud for conducting a $135 million Ponzi scheme with real estate investments from hundreds of elderly Cuban-American investors living in South Florida. The SEC alleges that Gaston E. Cantens and Teresita Cantens, the founders and co-owners of real estate development company Royal West Properties Inc., sold promissory notes to investors after acquiring various properties and later financing their sale. The Cantens lured investors by promising the investments in their real estate business were safe and secure with annual returns between 9 and 16 percent. However, when property owners defaulted on their mortgages, Royal West's financial condition deteriorated and the Cantens used new investor money to repay earlier investors and afford the firm's operating costs. The Cantens also misappropriated more than $20 million from investors to fund unrelated personal business ventures, pay themselves high salaries, and divert money to their children and grandchildren. The Cantens were not registered with the SEC under the federal securities laws to make securities offerings to investors. ""The Cantens used their prominent standing in a close-knit Cuban-American community to ruthlessly exploit vulnerable elderly investors who trusted them with their life savings,"" said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC's Miami Regional Office. ""They portrayed themselves as a pious couple closely involved with educational and religious organizations, while in reality they were living lavishly off money from defrauded investors."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the Cantens gained the trust of prospective investors in typical affinity fraud fashion by cultivating an impression within their community that it was a privilege to invest with them. The Cantens emphasized that Jesuit priests and other well-known leaders in the Cuban-American community had invested with Royal West. They targeted investors at charitable and religious gatherings and at social functions in their home. They also recruited investors through their contacts with alumni and others associated with a local private boys' school where Gaston Cantens served on the Board of Advisors. Besides word of mouth, the Cantens also attracted potential investors who learned of Royal West properties through television commercials broadcast on Spanish-language channels nationwide. The SEC alleges that the Cantens made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions about the safety and security of investors' principal and returns, the success of Royal West's business, the source of purported investment returns, and the use of investor funds. The Cantens told potential investors that Royal West generated investors' returns through the sale of land and its mortgage receivables business, which they claimed was highly successful. These representations were false because Royal West was not generating sufficient income from its real estate business and mortgage receivables to pay its business expenses or investors' principal and interest payments. By 2002, the Cantens had resorted to using new investor funds to make principal and interest payments to earlier investors. Even after Royal West entered dire financial condition, the Cantens continued to falsely tout their business as financially successful in order to attract new investors and raise additional millions of dollars to continue the Ponzi scheme. The SEC further alleges that the Cantens falsely represented that the promissory notes were collateralized by mortgages or mortgage obligations. In fact, Royal West did not record as many as one-third of the assignments of mortgage receivables that served to collateralize investors' promissory notes. Royal West also assigned the same mortgage receivables to multiple investors at the same time. The SEC's complaint charges the Cantens with violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, sworn accountings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and financial penalties against the Cantens.",-0.21739130434782608,Negative
567,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Wall Street investment banker, another securities professional, and one of their friends in a clandestine insider trading ring that netted approximately $1 million in illicit profits by trading ahead of at least 11 mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate deals. The SEC alleges that Igor Poteroba, a high-ranking investment banker in UBS Securities LLCâs Global Healthcare Group in New York City, tipped his friend Aleksey Koval with highly confidential inside information about impending transactions involving pharmaceutical companies. Koval, who held positions at securities industry firms at the time, then traded in stocks and options of the companies targeted for acquisition. Koval also tipped their friend Alexander Vorobiev, who traded ahead of four of the deals. Among the means of communication used to illegally tip and trade on the inside information were coded e-mail messages that referred to securities and money as âfrequent flyer milesâ and âpotatoes.â They coded one e-mail exchange about insider trading as a discussion about a Macyâs wedding registry. âThey thought it was clever to use code words such as frequent flyer miles and wedding registry gifts to conceal their insider trading scheme,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThese words were code for nothing more than âwe are breaking the law.ââ Antonia Chion, an Associate Director in the SECâs Division of Enforcement, added, âSecurities professionals cannot exploit their positions of trust and confidence to illicitly enrich their friends and themselves.â According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Poteroba, Koval, and Vorobiev are each Russian citizens who attended college in the 1990s at the University of New Haven in Connecticut. Poteroba joined UBS in its Healthcare Group in 1999 and was steadily promoted into an Executive Director position in 2006. The SEC alleges that the scheme began as early as July 2005 when Poteroba illegally tipped Koval in advance of the acquisition of Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc. by MGI Pharma. Poteroba later sent a coded e-mail to Koval about the insider trading opportunity, signaling that Poteroba had previously given money to Koval and wanted to use those funds in this transaction: According to the SECâs complaint, Koval wired $5,000 into a brokerage account of Vorobiev that had been inactive for nearly six months. Koval then bought 2,100 shares of Guilford stock in the account at a total cost of $4,983. Both monetary amounts are consistent with the amount of 5,000 âsign-in bonus milesâ referred to in the coded e-mails. A few days later, Koval wired an additional $4,800 into Vorobievâs account and purchased an additional 2,030 shares of Guilford stock at a cost of $4,780. The money transfer and subsequent stock purchases are consistent with Kovalâs coded statement that he âwill get additional three to five K miles.â On July 21, 2005, Guilford publicly announced that it would be acquired by MGI Pharma, and Guilfordâs stock closed 41 percent higher than the increase over the prior dayâs closing price. That same day, Koval and Vorobiev sold most or all of the Guilford stock in their accounts as well as Guilford shares in a brokerage account in the name of Vorobievâs wife. With respect to subsequent insider trading transactions, the SECâs complaint alleges that Poteroba continued to supply confidential information to Koval about various impending mergers. They continued to use coded e-mail messages to maintain communications during the insider trading scheme. For example, after Poteroba illegally tipped Koval with material, nonpublic information concerning ID Biomedical Corporationâs plans to be acquired, they exchanged instructions by referring to money as potatoes: According to the SECâs complaint, the â6.8 kiloâ figure is an approximate reference to $7,000 that had been wired out of a brokerage account two weeks earlier and subsequently returned. The SECâs complaint alleges that Poteroba and Koval used another coded e-mail communication to conduct insider trading based on material, nonpublic information about an acquisition involving Molecular Devices Corporation: According to the SECâs complaint, Poteroba and Koval exchanged the coded messages to signal that Koval should purchase Molecular securities (âget registered for as many items as possibleâ) and that the opportunity to buy Molecular securities prior to the public announcement would last until Friday, Jan. 26, 2007 (âsale ends on Fridayâ). The SEC alleges that some of the insider trading was conducted through brokerage accounts held in the names of Tatiana Vorobieva (Vorobievâs wife) and Anjali Walter (Kovalâs wife) and that portions of the proceeds from the illicit trading were received by Vorobieva and Walter. Accordingly, Vorobieva and Walter are named as relief defendants to recover investor assets now in their possession. The SECâs complaint charges Poteroba, Koval, and Vorobiev with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10-b5 thereunder, the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, the tender offer fraud provisions. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of financial penalties against the defendants, and disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest from the relief defendants. The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their cooperation and assistance in this matter. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission. The SEC also acknowledges the cooperation of UBS Securities LLC.

568,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced administrative proceedings against Memphis, Tenn.-based firms Morgan Keegan & Company and Morgan Asset Management and two employees accused of fraudulently overstating the value of securities backed by subprime mortgages. The SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that Morgan Keegan failed to employ reasonable procedures to internally price the portfolio securities in five funds managed by Morgan Asset, and consequently did not calculate accurate ""net asset values"" (NAVs) for the funds. Morgan Keegan recklessly published these inaccurate daily NAVs, and sold shares to investors based on the inflated prices. ""This scheme had two architects â a portfolio manager responsible for lies to investors about the true value of the assets in his funds, and a head of fund accounting who turned a blind eye to the fund's bogus valuation process,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. William Hicks, Associate Director in the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, said, ""This misconduct masked from investors the true impact of the subprime mortgage meltdown on these funds."" According to the Commission's order instituting administrative proceedings, the SEC's Enforcement Division alleges that James C. Kelsoe, Jr., the portfolio manager of the funds and an employee of Morgan Asset and Morgan Keegan, arbitrarily instructed the firm's Fund Accounting department to make ""price adjustments"" that increased the fair values of certain portfolio securities. The price adjustments ignored lower values for those same securities quoted by various dealers as part of the pricing validation process. The Enforcement Division further alleges that Kelsoe actively screened and manipulated the pricing quotes obtained from at least one broker-dealer. With many of the funds' securities backed by subprime mortgages, Kelsoe's actions fraudulently prevented a reduction in the NAVs of the funds that otherwise should have occurred as a result of the deterioration in the subprime securities market. The SEC's Division of Enforcement additionally alleges that Joseph Thompson Weller, a CPA who was head of the Fund Accounting Department and a member of the Valuation Committee, did nothing to remedy the deficiencies in Morgan Keegan's valuation procedures, nor did he otherwise make sure that fair-valued securities were being accurately priced and NAVs were being accurately calculated. According to the SEC's order initiating proceedings, Morgan Keegan priced each portfolio's securities and calculated its daily NAV through its Fund Accounting Department. The NAV of an investment company is its total assets minus its total liabilities. An investment company calculates the NAV of a single share by dividing its NAV by the number of shares that are outstanding. According to the SEC's order, each fund held various amounts of securities backed by subprime mortgages and lacked readily available market quotations. Therefore, the securities were internally priced using fair value methods to determine the amount that the funds would reasonably expect to receive on a current sale of the security. In SEC filings, the funds stated that the fair value of securities would be determined by a valuation committee using procedures adopted by the funds. In fact, the responsibility was essentially delegated to Morgan Keegan, which along with the valuation committee failed to comply with the funds' procedures in several ways. The SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that from at least January 2007 to July 2007, Kelsoe had his assistant send approximately 262 ""price adjustments"" to Fund Accounting. In many instances, these adjustments were arbitrary and did not reflect fair value. Despite the lack of any supporting documentation, Kelsoe's price adjustments were routinely entered into a spreadsheet used to calculate the NAVs of the funds. Kelsoe also routinely instructed Fund Accounting to ignore month-end quotes from broker-dealers that were supposed to be used to validate the prices the firm had assigned to the funds' securities. A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the respondents committed the alleged violations and provide them an opportunity to defend the allegations. The hearing also will determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate in the public interest, and whether financial penalties should be imposed. The Commission appreciates the assistance of FINRA and a task force of the securities regulators of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Illinois.

571,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs & Co. and one of its vice presidents for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts about a financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was beginning to falter. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO. ""The product was new and complex but the deception and conflicts are old and simple,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the Division of Enforcement. ""Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party."" Kenneth Lench, Chief of the SEC's Structured and New Products Unit, added, ""The SEC continues to investigate the practices of investment banks and others involved in the securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S. housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress."" The SEC alleges that one of the world's largest hedge funds, Paulson & Co., paid Goldman Sachs to structure a transaction in which Paulson & Co. could take short positions against mortgage securities chosen by Paulson & Co. based on a belief that the securities would experience credit events. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the marketing materials for the CDO known as ABACUS 2007-AC1 (ABACUS) all represented that the RMBS portfolio underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management LLC (ACA), a third party with expertise in analyzing credit risk in RMBS. The SEC alleges that undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, the Paulson & Co. hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the RMBS defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which RMBS should make up the portfolio. The SEC's complaint alleges that after participating in the portfolio selection, Paulson & Co. effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default swaps (CDS) with Goldman Sachs to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS capital structure. Given that financial short interest, Paulson & Co. had an economic incentive to select RMBS that it expected to experience credit events in the near future. Goldman Sachs did not disclose Paulson & Co.'s short position or its role in the collateral selection process in the term sheet, flip book, offering memorandum, or other marketing materials provided to investors. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs Vice President Fabrice Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1. Tourre structured the transaction, prepared the marketing materials, and communicated directly with investors. Tourre allegedly knew of Paulson & Co.'s undisclosed short interest and role in the collateral selection process. In addition, he misled ACA into believing that Paulson & Co. invested approximately $200 million in the equity of ABACUS, indicating that Paulson & Co.'s interests in the collateral selection process were closely aligned with ACA's interests. In reality, however, their interests were sharply conflicting. According to the SEC's complaint, the deal closed on April 26, 2007, and Paulson & Co. paid Goldman Sachs approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing ABACUS. By Oct. 24, 2007, 83 percent of the RMBS in the ABACUS portfolio had been downgraded and 17 percent were on negative watch. By Jan. 29, 2008, 99 percent of the portfolio had been downgraded. Investors in the liabilities of ABACUS are alleged to have lost more than $1 billion.

The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs Vice President Fabrice Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1. Tourre structured the transaction, prepared the marketing materials, and communicated directly with investors. Tourre allegedly knew of Paulson & Co.'s undisclosed short interest and role in the collateral selection process. In addition, he misled ACA into believing that Paulson & Co. invested approximately $200 million in the equity of ABACUS, indicating that Paulson & Co.'s interests in the collateral selection process were closely aligned with ACA's interests. In reality, however, their interests were sharply conflicting. According to the SEC's complaint, the deal closed on April 26, 2007, and Paulson & Co. paid Goldman Sachs approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing ABACUS. By Oct. 24, 2007, 83 percent of the RMBS in the ABACUS portfolio had been downgraded and 17 percent were on negative watch. By Jan. 29, 2008, 99 percent of the portfolio had been downgraded. Investors in the liabilities of ABACUS are alleged to have lost more than $1 billion. The SEC's complaint charges Goldman Sachs and Tourre with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

575,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs & Co. and one of its vice presidents for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts about a financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was beginning to falter.

582,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs & Co. and one of its vice presidents for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts about a financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was beginning to falter. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO. ""The product was new and complex but the deception and conflicts are old and simple,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the Division of Enforcement. ""Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party."" Kenneth Lench, Chief of the SEC's Structured and New Products Unit, added, ""The SEC continues to investigate the practices of investment banks and others involved in the securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S. housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress."" The SEC alleges that one of the world's largest hedge funds, Paulson & Co., paid Goldman Sachs to structure a transaction in which Paulson & Co. could take short positions against mortgage securities chosen by Paulson & Co. based on a belief that the securities would experience credit events. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the marketing materials for the CDO known as ABACUS 2007-AC1 (ABACUS) all represented that the RMBS portfolio underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management LLC (ACA), a third party with expertise in analyzing credit risk in RMBS. The SEC alleges that undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, the Paulson & Co. hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the RMBS defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which RMBS should make up the portfolio. The SEC's complaint alleges that after participating in the portfolio selection, Paulson & Co. effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default swaps (CDS) with Goldman Sachs to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS capital structure. Given that financial short interest, Paulson & Co. had an economic incentive to select RMBS that it expected to experience credit events in the near future. Goldman Sachs did not disclose Paulson & Co.'s short position or its role in the collateral selection process in the term sheet, flip book, offering memorandum, or other marketing materials provided to investors. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs Vice President Fabrice Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1. Tourre structured the transaction, prepared the marketing materials, and communicated directly with investors. Tourre allegedly knew of Paulson & Co.'s undisclosed short interest and role in the collateral selection process. In addition, he misled ACA into believing that Paulson & Co. invested approximately $200 million in the equity of ABACUS, indicating that Paulson & Co.'s interests in the collateral selection process were closely aligned with ACA's interests. In reality, however, their interests were sharply conflicting. According to the SEC's complaint, the deal closed on April 26, 2007, and Paulson & Co. paid Goldman Sachs approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing ABACUS. By Oct. 24, 2007, 83 percent of the RMBS in the ABACUS portfolio had been downgraded and 17 percent were on negative watch. By Jan. 29, 2008, 99 percent of the portfolio had been downgraded. Investors in the liabilities of ABACUS are alleged to have lost more than $1 billion. The SEC's complaint charges Goldman Sachs and Tourre with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the marketing materials for the CDO known as ABACUS 2007-AC1 (ABACUS) all represented that the RMBS portfolio underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management LLC (ACA), a third party with expertise in analyzing credit risk in RMBS. The SEC alleges that undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, the Paulson & Co. hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the RMBS defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which RMBS should make up the portfolio. The SEC's complaint alleges that after participating in the portfolio selection, Paulson & Co. effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default swaps (CDS) with Goldman Sachs to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS capital structure. Given that financial short interest, Paulson & Co. had an economic incentive to select RMBS that it expected to experience credit events in the near future. Goldman Sachs did not disclose Paulson & Co.'s short position or its role in the collateral selection process in the term sheet, flip book, offering memorandum, or other marketing materials provided to investors. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs Vice President Fabrice Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1. Tourre structured the transaction, prepared the marketing materials, and communicated directly with investors. Tourre allegedly knew of Paulson & Co.'s undisclosed short interest and role in the collateral selection process. In addition, he misled ACA into believing that Paulson & Co. invested approximately $200 million in the equity of ABACUS, indicating that Paulson & Co.'s interests in the collateral selection process were closely aligned with ACA's interests. In reality, however, their interests were sharply conflicting. According to the SEC's complaint, the deal closed on April 26, 2007, and Paulson & Co. paid Goldman Sachs approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing ABACUS. By Oct. 24, 2007, 83 percent of the RMBS in the ABACUS portfolio had been downgraded and 17 percent were on negative watch. By Jan. 29, 2008, 99 percent of the portfolio had been downgraded. Investors in the liabilities of ABACUS are alleged to have lost more than $1 billion.

594,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Walt Disney Company employee and her boyfriend in a scheme to sell confidential information about Disney's quarterly earnings to hedge funds. The SEC alleges Bonnie Jean Hoxie â an administrative assistant to a high-level Disney executive â and her boyfriend Yonni Sebbag sent anonymous letters in March 2010 to more than 20 hedge funds in the U.S. and Europe, offering to provide pre-release results of Disney's second quarter 2010 earnings in exchange for a fee. Some hedge funds alerted the SEC, which immediately worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate. The FBI set up an undercover operation and made several contacts with Sebbag who offered to sell the information, in one instance for $15,000 and in another for half the expected trading profits. In early May, Hoxie obtained confidential information concerning Disney's quarterly earnings and provided it to Sebbag, who in turn sold it to an FBI agent posing as an investment manager. ""Hoxie and Sebbag stole Disney's confidential pre-release earnings information and put it up for sale,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Fortunately, multiple hedge funds reported the illicit scheme, and the SEC and criminal law enforcement authorities acted quickly to stop this brazen attempt to establish an ongoing insider trading business."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Hoxie had regular access to confidential information concerning Disney's financial performance and operating plans. Hoxie and Sebbag orchestrated a scheme to sell information to hedge funds to be used for purposes of insider trading. The SEC alleges that Sebbag told FBI agents posing as investment managers that he wanted to establish a business relationship to share confidential information on a regular basis, and wanted to be compensated. Sebbag also expressed his understanding of the risks involved and his desire to avoid being caught. Among excerpts of Sebbag's e-mails to undercover agents (includes original spelling and punctuation): The SEC alleges that two days before Disney's earnings announcement, Sebbag e-mailed the undercover agents a 107-page confidential document that contained a series of talking points for Disney executives during an upcoming quarterly earnings conference call. It contained very detailed information about the quarterly performance and future prospects of Disney's various business segments. The SEC further alleges that Hoxie learned that Disney's Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the quarter and provided that information to Sebbag, who in turn provided it to an undercover agent approximately two hours before its public release. According to the SEC's complaint, Sebbag made arrangements to meet the undercover agents in person so he could collect his payment. At a May 14 meeting in New York, Sebbag told the agents he wanted ""to make a lot of money"" through the arrangement and asked for their advice on how to open up an off-shore account to deposit his proceeds from the scheme, stating that he didn't ""want to go to jail."" Sebbag left the meeting with an envelope containing $15,000 in cash, and he subsequently made arrangements to meet with them again in California to continue building the illicit relationship. The FBI arrested Sebbag and Hoxie today. By offering to sell and selling material non-public information to be used for the purposes of insider trading, Sebbag and Hoxie engaged in acts or practices that constitute violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission seeks an order providing for permanent injunctive relief against Sebbag and Hoxie pursuant to Section 21(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and permanently enjoining each defendant from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

595,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut-based hedge fund manager Pequot Capital Management, Inc., and its Chairman and CEO Arthur Samberg with insider trading in Microsoft Corporation securities. The SEC separately brought an enforcement action against a former Microsoft employee who later worked at Pequot for allegedly tipping the firm and Samberg with nonpublic information about Microsoft's earnings. Pequot and Samberg agreed to pay nearly $28 million to settle the SEC's charges. The SEC Division of Enforcement's case against the tipper, David Zilkha, will continue in an administrative proceeding before the Commission. ""The cases have two particularly troubling aspects â a hedge fund manager trading on illegal insider information, and his tipper source who withheld crucial information about the scheme during an SEC investigation,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Both are high-priority targets for SEC Enforcement."" The SEC's complaint against Pequot and Samberg, filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, alleges that amid rumors in April 2001 that Microsoft would miss its earnings estimates for the quarter that had just ended, Samberg sought information from Zilkha, a Microsoft employee who had just accepted an offer from Samberg to work at Pequot. Zilkha quickly reached out to a Microsoft colleague, who sent him an e-mail stating that the company would meet or beat its earnings estimates for the quarter. According to the SEC's complaint, Zilkha then conveyed to Samberg his understanding that Microsoft would meet or beat its earnings estimates. Samberg thereafter traded in Microsoft on behalf of funds managed by Pequot. On April 19, after the market had closed, Microsoft announced that it beat its earnings estimates, driving up the price of Microsoft's stock. As a result of the illegal trading by Pequot and Samberg, the Pequot funds made more than $14 million. Pequot and Samberg agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations against them. Pequot and Samberg agreed to pay a total of nearly $18 million in disgorgement of trading profits and prejudgment interest as well as $10 million in penalties. With the exception of certain activities aimed solely at winding down Pequot, Samberg also has agreed to be barred from association with an investment adviser. In the insider trading enforcement action against Zilkha, the SEC Division of Enforcement also alleges that during a prior investigation into his conduct, Zilkha concealed from the SEC staff that he had received inside information about Microsoft's earnings and then recommended that Samberg buy Microsoft securities on the basis of this information. The Enforcement Division alleges that in 2005 and 2006, Zilkha did not produce nor disclose the existence of the e-mail he had received from a Microsoft colleague concerning Microsoft's earnings, despite subpoenas and direct questions that required him to do so. In January 2009, the SEC staff first received direct evidence that Zilkha had material, nonpublic information about Microsoft â when staff was provided copies of e-mails that had been located on a computer hard drive that was then in the possession of Zilkha's ex-wife.

596,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Manhattan-based financial advisor Kenneth Ira Starr with fraud and is seeking an emergency court order to freeze his assets after he stole client money for his personal use, including the purchase last month of a multi-million dollar apartment where he and his wife now reside. The SEC alleges that Starr and two entities he controls â Starr Investment Advisors LLC and Starr & Company LLC â have made unauthorized transfers of money in client accounts that ultimately wound up in Starrâs personal accounts. They violated securities laws pertaining to investment advisers in order to perpetrate the scheme. Most investment advisers do not maintain physical custody of their clientsâ assets, and those assets are instead held by qualified third-party custodians such as a regulated bank or a registered broker-dealer. In this case, the SEC alleges that certain client assets were held in a safe in Starr & Companyâs offices despite the fact that Starr and his firms were not qualified custodians. Their ability to steal client funds was enhanced by the failure of Starr Investment Advisors to comply with asset custody rules that require firms to engage an independent public accountant to perform yearly surprise examinations of client assets in the firmâs custody. âStarr breached his fiduciary duty as an investment adviser in the most egregious manner possible â he stole the funds his clients entrusted to him,â said George Canellos, Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âStarr betrayed the trust of some clients who have looked to him for years for investment advice and financial guidance.â According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Starr and his companies transferred $7 million from the accounts of three clients between April 13 and April 16, 2010, without any authorization. The transferred funds were ultimately used to purchase a $7.6 million apartment on the Upper East Side in Manhattan on April 16. When one of the clients detected the unauthorized transfer and demanded the money be returned, Starr reimbursed that client with money siphoned from the account of another client without authorization. The other two investors have not been reimbursed. The SECâs complaint alleges that the unauthorized transfers in April 2010 were not the only instances when Starr misappropriated client funds. In August 2009, Starr and his entities began transferring approximately $1.7 million from the personal account of a client and from the account of a charity run by this client. These were all unauthorized transfers. In April 2010, an additional transfer of $750,000 was attempted from an account belonging to this client. But this time, Starrâs plans were frustrated because the bank alerted the client, who then halted the transfer. The client then reviewed the account transactions and uncovered the unauthorized $1.7 million transfers in 2009. When confronted about these transactions, Starr gave improbable explanations before eventually reimbursing the client with money that appears to have come from the bank account of another unrelated party. The SECâs complaint names two relief defendants in order to recover client assets now in their possession: The SECâs complaint charges each of the three defendants with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and, further, charges Starr Investment Advisors with violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief, the SECâs complaint seeks permanent injunctions barring future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of the defendantsâ and relief defendantsâ ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and financial penalties from the defendants.

598,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Diebold, Inc. and three former financial executives for engaging in a fraudulent accounting scheme to inflate the company's earnings. The SEC separately filed an enforcement action against Diebold's former CEO seeking reimbursement of certain financial benefits that he received while Diebold was committing accounting fraud. The SEC alleges that Diebold's financial management received ""flash reports"" â sometimes on a daily basis â comparing the company's actual earnings to analyst earnings forecasts. Diebold's financial management prepared ""opportunity lists"" of ways to close the gap between the company's actual financial results and analyst forecasts. Many of the opportunities on these lists were fraudulent accounting transactions designed to improperly recognize revenue or otherwise inflate Diebold's financial performance. Diebold â an Ohio-based company that manufactures and sells ATMs, bank security systems and electronic voting machines â agreed to pay a $25 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges. Diebold's former CEO Walden O'Dell agreed to reimburse cash bonuses, stock, and stock options under the ""clawback"" provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The SEC's case against Diebold's former CFO Gregory Geswein, former Controller and later CFO Kevin Krakora, and former Director of Corporate Accounting Sandra Miller is ongoing. ""Diebold's financial executives borrowed from many different chapters of the deceptive accounting playbook to fraudulently boost the company's bottom line,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""When executives disregard their professional obligations to investors, both they and their companies face significant legal consequences."" Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley is an important investor protection provision because it encourages senior management to proactively take steps to prevent fraudulent schemes from happening on their watch. We will continue to seek reimbursement of bonuses and other incentive compensation from CEOs and CFOs in appropriate cases."" Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act deprives corporate executives of certain compensation received while their companies were misleading investors, even in cases where that executive is not alleged to have violated the securities laws personally. The SEC has not alleged that O'Dell engaged in the fraud. Under the settlement, O'Dell has agreed to reimburse the company $470,016 in cash bonuses, 30,000 shares of Diebold stock, and stock options for 85,000 shares of Diebold stock. According to the SEC's complaint against Diebold, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the company manipulated its earnings from at least 2002 through 2007 to meet financial performance forecasts, and made material misstatements and omissions to investors in dozens of SEC filings and press releases. Diebold's improper accounting practices misstated the company's reported pre-tax earnings by at least $127 million. Among the fraudulent accounting practices used to inflate earnings and meet forecasts were: Without admitting or denying the SEC's charges, Diebold consented to a final judgment ordering payment of the $25 million penalty and permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC charged Geswein, Krakora, and Miller, in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5 and 13b2-1; and aiding and abetting Diebold's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. In addition, the SEC charged Geswein and Krakora with violating Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 and Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SEC also seeks officer-and-director bars against Geswein and Krakora as well as their reimbursement of bonuses and other incentive and equity compensation. Scott Friestad, Robert Kaplan, Brian Quinn, Christopher Swart, Pierron Leef, and Kristen Dieter conducted the SEC's investigation in this matter. Litigation efforts in the ongoing case will be led by David Gottesman and Robyn Bender.

599,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chairman and majority owner of what was once the nation's largest non-depository mortgage lender with orchestrating a large-scale securities fraud scheme and attempting to scam the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The SEC alleges that Lee B. Farkas through his company Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (TBW) sold more than $1.5 billion worth of fabricated or impaired mortgage loans and securities to Colonial Bank. Those loans and securities were falsely reported to the investing public as high-quality, liquid assets. Farkas also was responsible for a bogus equity investment that caused Colonial Bank to misrepresent that it had satisfied a prerequisite necessary to qualify for TARP funds. When Colonial Bank's parent company â Colonial BancGroup, Inc. â issued a press release announcing it had obtained preliminary approval to receive $550 million in TARP funds, its stock price jumped 54 percent in the remaining two hours of trading, representing its largest one-day price increase since 1983. ""As the country's mortgage markets began to falter, Farkas arranged the sale of more than one billion dollars worth of mortgage loans and securities he knew to be fictitious or impaired,"" said Lorin Reisner, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Farkas also lied about a sham equity investment he engineered to defraud U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Farkas executed the fraudulent scheme from March 2002 until August 2009, when TBW â a privately-held company headquartered in Ocala, Fla. â filed for bankruptcy. TBW was the largest customer of Colonial Bank's Mortgage Warehouse Lending Division (MWLD). Because TBW generally did not have sufficient capital to internally fund the mortgage loans it originated, it relied on financing arrangements primarily through Colonial Bank's MWLD to fund such mortgage loans. According to the SEC's complaint, TBW began to experience liquidity problems and overdrew its then-limited warehouse line of credit with Colonial Bank by approximately $15 million each day. The SEC alleges that Farkas pressured an officer at Colonial Bank to assist in concealing TBW's overdraws through a pattern of ""kiting"" whereby certain debits to TBW's warehouse line of credit were not entered until after credits due to the warehouse line of credit for the following day were entered. As this kiting activity increased in scope, TBW was overdrawing its accounts with Colonial Bank by approximately $150 million per day. The SEC alleges that in order to conceal this initial fraudulent conduct, Farkas devised a plan for TBW to create and submit fictitious loan information to Colonial Bank. Farkas also directed the creation of fictitious mortgage-backed securities assembled from the fraudulent loans. By the end of 2007, the scheme consisted of approximately $500 million in fake residential mortgage loans and approximately $1 billion in severely impaired residential mortgage loans and securities. As a direct result of Farkas's misconduct, these fictitious and impaired loans were misrepresented as high-quality assets on Colonial BancGroup's financial statements. The SEC alleges that in addition to causing Colonial BancGroup to misrepresent its assets, Farkas caused BancGroup to misstate to investors and TARP officials that it had obtained commitments for a $300 million capital infusion, which would qualify Colonial Bank for TARP funding. Farkas falsely told BancGroup that a foreign-held investment bank had committed to financing TBW's equity investment in Colonial Bank. Contrary to his representations to BancGroup and the investing public, Farkas never secured financing or sufficient investors to fund the capital infusion. When BancGroup and TBW later mutually announced the termination of their stock purchase agreement, essentially signaling the end of Colonial Bank's pursuit of TARP funds, BancGroup's stock declined 20 percent. The SEC's complaint charges Farkas with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Farkas as well as an equitable order prohibiting him from serving in a senior management or control position at any mortgage-related company or other financial institution and from holding any position involving financial reporting or disclosure at a public company. The SEC's case was investigated by William P. Hicks, M. Graham Loomis, Aaron W. Lipson, Yolanda L. Ross and Barry R. Lakas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the TARP, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Office of the Inspector General, and the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

600,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based investment adviser and three of his affiliated firms with fraudulently managing investment products tied to the mortgage markets as they came under pressure in 2007. The SEC alleges that, at the direction of its owner and president Thomas Priore, ICP Asset Management LLC defrauded four multi-billion-dollar collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) by engaging in fraudulent practices and misrepresentations that caused the CDOs to lose tens of millions of dollars. Priore and his companies also improperly obtained tens of millions of dollars in advisory fees and undisclosed profits at the expense of their clients and investors. ""ICP and Priore repeatedly put themselves ahead of their clients,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. ""Instead of acting as fiduciaries, they took advantage of a distressed market to line their own pockets."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ICP began serving in 2006 as the collateral manager for what were known as the Triaxx CDOs, which invested primarily in mortgage-backed securities. ICP's affiliated broker-dealer ICP Securities LLC and its parent company Institutional Credit Partners LLC also are charged in the SEC's complaint. The SEC alleges that ICP and Priore directed more than a billion dollars of trades for the Triaxx CDOs at what they knew were inflated prices. ICP and Priore repeatedly caused the Triaxx CDOs to overpay for securities in order to make money for ICP and protect other ICP clients from realizing losses. The prices for such trades often exceeded market prices by substantial margins. In some trades, ICP caused the CDOs to pay a price that was substantially higher than the price another ICP client paid for the security earlier the same day. George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said, ""The CDOs were complex but the lesson is simple: collateral managers bear the same responsibilities to their clients as every other investment adviser. When they violate their clients' trust, we will hold them accountable."" According to the SEC's complaint, ICP and Priore caused the CDOs to make numerous prohibited investments without obtaining necessary approvals, and they later misrepresented those investments to the trustee of the CDOs and to investors. The prices of many of these investments were intentionally inflated to allow ICP to collect millions of dollars in advisory fees from the CDOs. The SEC further alleges that ICP and Priore executed undisclosed cash transfers from a hedge fund they managed in order to allow another ICP client to meet the margin calls of one of its creditors. Priore subsequently misrepresented the transfers to the hedge fund's investors. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1)(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-3 and 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(3), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2, 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions barring future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains with pre-judgment interest, and monetary penalties.

601,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settlement with Technip for multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The SEC alleged that Technip, a global engineering, construction and services company based in Paris, France, was part of a four-company joint venture that bribed Nigerian government officials over a 10-year period in order to win construction contracts in Nigeria worth more than $6 billion. The SEC also charged that Technip engaged in books and records and internal controls violations related to the bribery. Technip will pay $98 million to settle the SECâs charges and deprive the company of its ill-gotten gains. The firm will pay an additional $240 million penalty in separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice. Previously, one of Technipâs joint venture partners, KBR, Inc., and its former parent Halliburton Co., settled to similar charges. Together with Technipâs payment, the combined sanctions of $917 million represent the largest combined settlements ever paid to date to the U.S. resulting from an FCPA violation. Technipâs American Depository Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange from August 2001 to November 2007. âBribery was such an accepted practice that the joint venture had a euphemistically-named âCultural Committeeâ where bribes were openly discussed, approved and memorialized,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAll U.S. issuers must comply with anti-bribery laws.â Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement, added, âWhen Technip became a U.S. issuer in 2001, it had an obligation to comply with the FCPA. Instead, the complaint alleges that the company continued with its brazen plan to make bribery payments.â The SEC alleges that between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at Technip and other members of TSKJ, a four-company joint venture that includes KBR, Inc., devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain multi-billion dollar contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facilities. According to the SECâs complaint, from the inception of the joint venture, Technip and the other joint venture partners paid bribes to assist in obtaining the LNG contracts. The joint venture partners formed a âcultural committee,â comprised of senior sales executives at each company, to consider how to carry out the bribery scheme. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham contracts with a shell company controlled by a U.K. solicitor and a Japanese trading company as conduits for the bribes. Total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million. The SECâs complaint also alleges that Technipâs internal controls failed to detect or prevent the bribery, and that the companyâs records were falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. After Technip became a U.S. issuer in August 2001, it became subject to the FCPA, including the FCPAâs prohibitions on the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Although Technip was aware of these prohibitions, it did not implement adequate controls to ensure compliance with the FCPA. Instead, its due diligence was a âperfunctory exerciseâ conducted so that Technip would have some documentation in its files. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Technip has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering Technip to disgorge $98 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme and prejudgment interest. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval. In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal action against Technip, charging one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Technip has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $240 million. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

602,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Dell Inc. with failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses. The SEC alleges that Dell did not disclose to investors large exclusivity payments the company received from Intel Corporation to not use central processing units (CPUs) manufactured by Intelâs main rival. It was these payments rather than the companyâs management and operations that allowed Dell to meet its earnings targets. After Intel cut these payments, Dell again misled investors by not disclosing the true reason behind the companyâs decreased profitability. The SEC charged Dell Chairman and CEO Michael Dell, former CEO Kevin Rollins, and former CFO James Schneider for their roles in the disclosure violations. The SEC charged Schneider, former regional Vice President of Finance Nicholas Dunning, and former Assistant Controller Leslie Jackson for their roles in the improper accounting. Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle the SECâs charges. Michael Dell and Rollins each agreed to pay a $4 million penalty, and Schneider agreed to pay $3 million, to settle the SECâs charges against them. Dunning and Jackson also agreed to settle the SECâs charges. âAccuracy and completeness are the touchstones of public company disclosure under the federal securities laws,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âMichael Dell and other senior Dell executives fell short of that standard repeatedly over many years, and today they are held accountable.â Christopher Conte, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement, added, âDell manipulated its accounting over an extended period to project financial results that the company wished it had achieved, but could not. Dell was only able to meet Wall Street targets consistently during this period by breaking the rules. The financial results that public companies communicate to the investing public must reflect reality.â The SECâs complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that Dell Inc., Michael Dell, Rollins, and Schneider misrepresented the basis for the companyâs ability to consistently meet or exceed consensus analyst EPS estimates from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2006. Without the Intel payments, Dell would have missed the EPS consensus in every quarter during this period. The SECâs complaint further alleges that Dellâs most senior former accounting personnel including Schneider, Dunning, and Jackson engaged in improper accounting by maintaining a series of âcookie jarâ reserves that it used to cover shortfalls in operating results from FY 2002 to FY 2005. Dellâs fraudulent accounting made it appear that it was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses through the companyâs management and operations. According to the SECâs complaint, Intel made exclusivity payments to Dell in order for Dell to not use CPUs manufactured by its rival â Advance Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). These exclusivity payments grew from 10 percent of Dellâs operating income in FY 2003 to 38 percent in FY 2006, and peaked at 76 percent in the first quarter of FY 2007. The SEC alleges that Dell Inc., Michael Dell, Rollins, and Schneider failed to disclose the basis for the companyâs sharp drop in its operating results in its second quarter of FY 2007 as Intel cut its payments after Dell announced its intention to begin using AMD CPUs. In dollar terms, the reduction in Intel exclusivity payments was equivalent to 75 percent of the decline in Dellâs operating income. Michael Dell, Rollins, and Schneider had been warned in the past that Intel would cut its funding if Dell added AMD as a vendor. Nevertheless, in Dellâs second quarter FY 2007 earnings call, they told investors that the sharp drop in the companyâs operating results was attributable to Dell pricing too aggressively in the face of slowing demand and to component costs declining less than expected. The SECâs complaint further alleges that the reserve manipulations allowed Dell to materially misstate its earnings and its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue â an important financial metric that the company itself highlighted â for more than three years. The manipulations also enabled Dell to misstate materially the trend and amount of operating income of its EMEA segment, an important business unit that Dell also highlighted, from the third quarter of FY 2003 through the first quarter of FY 2005. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Dell Inc. consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Dell Inc. also agreed to enhance its Disclosure Review Committee and disclosure processes, including the retention of an independent consultant to recommend improvements to those processes and enhance training regarding the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. Michael Dell and Rollins settled the SECâs disclosure charges, without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, by each agreeing to pay the $4 million penalties and consenting to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins each of them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and from violating or aiding and abetting violations of other provisions of the federal securities laws. Schneider consented to settle the disclosure and accounting fraud charges against him without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, and agreed to pay the $3 million penalty, disgorgement of $83,096, and prejudgment interest of $38,640. Dunning and Jackson consented to settle the SECâs improper accounting charges without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations. Dunning agreed to pay a penalty of $50,000. In their settlement offers, Schneider, Dunning and Jackson consented to the issuance of administrative orders pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, suspending each of them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years for Schneider and three years for Dunning and Jackson. The SECâs investigation is continuing as to other individuals. James Blenko, Shelby Hunt, Jonathan Jacobs, Ian Rupell, Robert Peak, Brian Palechek, and Jeffrey Anderson conducted the SECâs investigation in this matter.

603,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged General Electric Company with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its involvement in a $3.6 million kickback scheme with Iraqi government agencies to win contracts to supply medical equipment and water purification equipment. The SEC alleges that two GE subsidiaries â along with two other subsidiaries of public companies that have since been acquired by GE â made illegal kickback payments in the form of cash, computer equipment, medical supplies, and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry or the Iraqi Oil Ministry in order to obtain valuable contracts under the U.N. Oil for Food Program. GE agreed to pay $23.4 million to settle the SEC's charges against the company as well as the two subsidiaries for which GE assumed liability upon acquiring: Ionics Inc. and Amersham plc. The SEC charged GE, Ionics and Amersham with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The SEC has now taken 15 FCPA enforcement actions against companies involved in Oil for Food-related kickback schemes with Iraq, recovering more than $204 million. ""Bribes and kickbacks are bad business, period,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This case affirms that law enforcement is active across the globe - offshore does not mean off-limits."" Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, added, ""GE failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect and prevent these illicit payments by its two subsidiaries to win Oil for Food contracts, and it failed to properly record the true nature of the payments in its accounting records. Furthermore, corporate acquisitions do not provide GE immunity from FCPA enforcement of the other two subsidiaries involved."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the kickback scheme occurred from approximately 2000 to 2003. GE subsidiaries Marquette-Hellige and OEC-Medical Systems (Europa) AG made approximately $2.04 million in kickback payments to the Iraqi government under the Oil for Food Program. Ionics Italba S.r.L. (a then-subsidiary of Ionics) and Nycomed Imaging AS (a then-subsidiary of Amersham) made approximately $1.55 million in cash kickback payments. Since their acquisitions by GE, Amersham and Ionics are now known as GE Healthcare Ltd. and GE Ionics, Inc., respectively. The SEC alleges that Germany-based Marquette paid or agreed to pay illegal kickbacks in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services on three contracts worth $8.8 million. Through an Iraqi third-party agent, Marquette paid goods and services worth approximately $1.2 million to the Iraqi Health Ministry in order to obtain two of the contracts. The agent offered to make an additional in-kind kickback payment worth approximately $250,000 to obtain the third contract. The SEC further alleges that Switzerland-based OEC-Medical made an in-kind kickback payment of approximately $870,000 on one contract worth $2.1 million through the same third-party agent who handled the Marquette contracts. OEC-Medical and the agent entered into a fictitious ""services provider agreement"" identifying phony services the agent would perform in order to justify his increased commission and conceal the illegal kickback from U.N. inspectors. According to the SEC's complaint, Norway-based Nycomed entered into nine contracts with Iraqi ministries involving the payment of approximately $750,000 in cash kickbacks between 2000 and 2002. As a result, Nycomed earned approximately $5 million in wrongful profits on the contracts. GE acquired Nycomed's parent company â Amersham â in 2004. Italy-based Ionics Italba was a subsidiary of Ionics, Inc., which GE acquired in 2005. Between 2000 and 2002, Ionics Italba paid $795,000 in kickbacks and earned $2.3 million in wrongful profits on five Program contracts to sell water treatment equipment to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. GE acquired its parent company - Ionics Inc., in 2005. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GE as well as Ionics (now GE Ionics Inc.) and Amersham (now GE Healthcare Ltd.) have consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. GE is ordered to pay $18,397,949 in disgorgement of profits, $4,080,665 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $1 million. GE cooperated with the investigation.

604,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Citigroup Inc. with misleading investors about the company's exposure to subprime mortgage-related assets. The SEC also charged one current and one former executive for their roles in causing Citigroup to make the misleading statements in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that in response to intense investor interest on the topic, Citigroup repeatedly made misleading statements in earnings calls and public filings about the extent of its holdings of assets backed by subprime mortgages. Between July and mid-October 2007, Citigroup represented that subprime exposure in its investment banking unit was $13 billion or less, when in fact it was more than $50 billion. Citigroup and the two executives agreed to settle the SEC's charges. Citigroup agreed to pay a $75 million penalty. Former chief financial officer Gary Crittenden agreed to pay $100,000, and former head of investor relations Arthur Tildesley, Jr., (currently the head of cross marketing at Citigroup) agreed to pay $80,000. ""Even as late as fall 2007, as the mortgage market was rapidly deteriorating, Citigroup boasted of superior risk management skills in reducing its subprime exposure to approximately $13 billion. In fact, billions more in CDO and other subprime exposure sat on its books undisclosed to investors,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The rules of financial disclosure are simple â if you choose to speak, speak in full and not in half-truths."" Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Citigroup's improper disclosures came at a critical time when investors were clamoring for details about Wall Street firms' exposure to subprime securities. Instead of providing clear and accurate information to the market, Citigroup dropped the ball and made a bad situation worse."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Citigroup represented in earnings calls and public filings from July 20 to Oct. 15, 2007, that its investment bank's subprime exposure was $13 billion or less and had declined over the course of 2007. However, the $13 billion figure reported by Citigroup omitted two categories of subprime-backed assets: ""super senior"" tranches of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and ""liquidity puts."" Citigroup had more than $40 billion of additional subprime exposure in these categories, which it didn't disclose until November 2007 after a decline in their value. The SEC's complaint alleges that as early as April 2007, Citigroup's senior management began to gather information on the investment bank's subprime exposure for purposes of possible public disclosure. From the outset of these efforts, internal documents describing the investment bank's subprime exposure included the super senior CDO tranches and the liquidity puts, while noting that they bore little risk of default. Nevertheless on four occasions in 2007, Citigroup stated that its investment bank's subprime exposure was reduced to $13 billion from $24 billion at the end of 2006 â without disclosing the more than $40 billion in additional subprime exposure relating to the super senior CDO tranches and liquidity puts. These occasions included a July 20 earnings call, a July 27 Fixed Income investors call, an October 1 earnings pre-announcement, and an October 15 earnings call. According to the SEC's order instituting administrative proceedings against Crittenden and Tildesley, they were repeatedly provided with information about the full extent of Citigroup's subprime exposure. Crittenden received a detailed briefing on valuation issues relating to the super senior tranches of CDOs in early September 2007. Tildesley received information that same month that discussed the possibility that Citigroup's disclosures could be misleading because they did not include the amounts of the super senior tranches and the liquidity puts. The SEC's order finds that both Crittenden and Tildesley helped draft and then approved the disclosures that were included in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Oct. 1, 2007. The SEC's order finds that, in doing so, Crittenden and Tildesley caused Citigroup's filing to be misleading to investors. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Citigroup Inc. consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violation of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11. Crittenden and Tildesley, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, consented to the issuance of an administrative order requiring them to cease-and-desist from causing any violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11.

605,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Citigroup Inc. with misleading investors about the company's exposure to subprime mortgage-related assets. The SEC also charged one current and one former executive for their roles in causing Citigroup to make the misleading statements in an SEC filing. The SEC alleges that in response to intense investor interest on the topic, Citigroup repeatedly made misleading statements in earnings calls and public filings about the extent of its holdings of assets backed by subprime mortgages. Between July and mid-October 2007, Citigroup represented that subprime exposure in its investment banking unit was $13 billion or less, when in fact it was more than $50 billion. Citigroup and the two executives agreed to settle the SEC's charges. Citigroup agreed to pay a $75 million penalty. Former chief financial officer Gary Crittenden agreed to pay $100,000, and former head of investor relations Arthur Tildesley, Jr., (currently the head of cross marketing at Citigroup) agreed to pay $80,000. ""Even as late as fall 2007, as the mortgage market was rapidly deteriorating, Citigroup boasted of superior risk management skills in reducing its subprime exposure to approximately $13 billion. In fact, billions more in CDO and other subprime exposure sat on its books undisclosed to investors,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.

606,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged brothers Samuel E. Wyly and Charles J. Wyly, Jr. of Dallas with violating federal securities laws governing ownership and trading of securities by corporate insiders. The Wyly brothers reaped more than $550 million in undisclosed gains while sitting on corporate boards by trading stock in those public companies through hidden entities located in foreign jurisdictions to conceal their ownership and trading of those securities. The SEC alleges that the brothers created an elaborate sham system of trusts and subsidiary companies in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands to sell more than $750 million worth of stock in four public companies for which they were corporate directors. They also committed an insider trading violation in one of the companies for an unlawful gain of more than $31.7 million. Along with the Wylys, the SEC charged their attorney Michael C. French of Dallas and their stockbroker Louis J. Schaufele III of Dallas for their roles in the fraudulent scheme. French was on the board of directors at three of the companies. ""The cloak of secrecy has been lifted from the complex web of foreign structures used by the Wylys to evade the securities laws,"" said Lorin L. Reisner, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""They used these structures to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of gains in violation of the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders."" According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the public companies the Wylys used in the scheme were Michaels Stores Inc., Sterling Software Inc., Sterling Commerce Inc., and Scottish Annuity & Life Holdings Ltd. (now known as Scottish Re Group Limited). The SEC's complaint alleges that the Wylys and French knew or were reckless in not knowing their legal obligations as public company directors and greater-than-five-percent beneficial owners. The laws require such persons to report holdings and trading in their companies' securities on Schedule 13D and Form 4, which are filed with the SEC. The Wylys and French also knew or were reckless in not knowing that the investing public routinely uses such disclosures to gauge the sentiment of public companies' insiders and large shareholders about the financial condition and prospects of those companies, relying on those disclosures when making investment decisions. The SEC alleges that the Wylys and French systematically and falsely created the impression that the Wylys' entire holdings and trading were limited to the fraction that they held and traded domestically. By depriving existing shareholders and potential investors of information deemed material by the federal securities laws, the Wylys were able to sell â in large-block trades alone â more than 14 million shares of issuer securities over a period of 13 years for undisclosed gains in excess of $550 million. The SEC further alleges that the sales generating most of these illicit gains were made pursuant to materially false or misleading SEC filings. According to the SEC's complaint, the Wylys exploited their illegal non-disclosure of their offshore issuer securities to make a massive and bullish transaction in Sterling Software in October 1999 based upon the material and non-public information that they â while serving as the company chairman and vice chairman â had jointly decided to sell the company. This insider trading yielded ill-gotten gains of more than $31.7 million when Sterling Software's sale was ultimately announced to the public less than four months later. The SEC alleges that the Wylys and French made hundreds of false and materially misleading statements to conceal their scheme. Schaufele also made materially misleading statements to brokerage firm intermediaries. The SEC alleges that the Wylys and French established and operated an offshore ""Wyly family office"" in the Cayman Islands as a conduit and repository for communications and records they wished to conceal. They allocated the Wylys' offshore holdings among various offshore entities that were often newly created and all under the control of the Wylys in an effort to avoid making required SEC filings. The SEC's complaint charges that all four defendants violated, and that French and Schaufele also aided and abetted the Wylys' violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys and French with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1 13d-2, 14a-3, 14a-9, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys with violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c); and charges the Wylys and French with aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 14(a) and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder as well as violations of Exchange Act Section 13(d) and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder. The complaint charges French with aiding and abetting the Wylys' violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties from all four defendants, and officer-and-director bars against the Wylys and French.

607,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the State of New Jersey with securities fraud for misrepresenting and failing to disclose to investors in billions of dollars worth of municipal bond offerings that it was underfunding the state's two largest pension plans. According to the SEC's order, New Jersey offered and sold more than $26 billion worth of municipal bonds in 79 offerings between August 2001 and April 2007. The offering documents for these securities created the false impression that the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) and the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) were being adequately funded, masking the fact that New Jersey was unable to make contributions to TPAF and PERS without raising taxes, cutting other services or otherwise affecting its budget. As a result, investors were not provided adequate information to evaluate the state's ability to fund the pensions or assess their impact on the state's financial condition. New Jersey is the first state ever charged by the SEC for violations of the federal securities laws. New Jersey agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the SEC's findings.

611,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Boulder, Colo.-based investment adviser Neal R. Greenberg with fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in the marketing and recommendation of his firm's hedge funds to investors, including many elderly clients. The SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that Greenberg falsely stated that the Agile hedge funds offered and managed by his two investment advisory firms were suitable for conservative investors who were retired or nearing retirement. However, the Agile hedge funds used leverage and concentrated in a small number of investments. The funds suffered substantial losses in September 2008 and ceased redemptions to investors. The SEC Division of Enforcement further alleges that the Agile hedge funds improperly collected approximately $2 million in management and performance fees that were not adequately disclosed to investors. ""Greenberg misrepresented the diversification, risks and fees involved with investing in the Agile hedge funds to conservative investors who were dependent upon their investment income for some or all of their living expenses,"" said Donald M. Hoerl, Director of the SEC's Denver Regional Office. ""Greenberg's unsuitable recommendations and misrepresentations deceived his advisory clients into believing their money was safe with him."" According to the SEC's order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Greenberg, the Agile hedge funds held approximately $174 million of capital from more than 100 investors when Greenberg suspended redemptions in September 2008. Greenberg was the CEO of his investment advisory firm Tactical Allocation Services LLC that made investment recommendations to clients, and the head portfolio manager for his other investment advisory firm Agile Group LLC, which managed the Agile hedge funds. The SEC's Division of Enforcement alleges that Greenberg falsely stated that the Agile hedge funds offered liquidity, immense diversification and minimal risk. He also falsely stated that the hedge funds could safely represent an investor's entire investment portfolio, and that they used leverage in a way that did not significantly increase the risk profile of the funds. The risk disclosures in private placement memoranda for the Agile hedge funds for 2007 and 2008 contradicted Greenberg's false and misleading verbal and written representations to investors. According to the SEC's order, the majority of Greenberg's advisory clients were generally conservative, older investors who wanted low-risk investments offering significant capital protection. The Division of Enforcement alleges that Greenberg failed to ensure that adequate compliance policies and procedures were developed or implemented for determining when it would be suitable for advisory clients to invest in complex hedge fund products, particularly for unsophisticated investors or elderly clients on limited incomes who were risk-averse. Greenberg also failed to ensure that adequate supervisory procedures were developed or implemented relating to those determinations. With regard to fees, the SEC's order notes that when one Agile hedge fund invested in another Agile hedge fund, investors were assessed performance and management fees on the leveraged portion of their investment. These fees, which totaled approximately $2 million between 2003 and 2006, were not disclosed to investors.

612,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged ABB Ltd with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for using subsidiaries to pay bribes to Mexican officials to obtain business with government-owned power companies, and to pay kickbacks to Iraq to obtain contracts under the U.N. Oil for Food Program. The SEC alleges that ABB's subsidiaries made at least $2.7 million in illicit payments in these schemes to obtain contracts that generated more than $100 million in revenues for ABB, a Swiss corporation that provides power and automation products and services worldwide. ABB has agreed to pay more than $39.3 million to settle the SEC's charges. ""This investigation uncovered millions of dollars in bribes paid or promised to officials at Mexico's largest power company,"" said Scott W.

""As the sanctions in this case demonstrate, there are significant consequences for public companies that fail to implement strong compliance programs and prevent corrupt payments to government officials. Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, added, ""ABB's violations involved conduct at a U.S. subsidiary and six foreign-based subsidiaries. Multi-national companies that make illicit payments through layers of subsidiaries will be held accountable."" The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that from 1999 to 2004, ABB Network Management (ABB NM) â a business unit within ABB's U.S. subsidiary â bribed officials in Mexico to obtain and retain business with two government owned electric utilities, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LyFZ). The bribes were funneled through ABB NM's agent and two other companies in Mexico. The SEC alleges that ABB failed to conduct due diligence on these payments and entities and improperly recorded the bribes on its books as payments for commissions and services on projects in Mexico. Illicit payments included checks and wire transfers to relatives of CFE officials, cash bribes to CFE officials, and a Mediterranean cruise vacation for CFE officials and their wives. As a result of this bribery scheme, ABB NM was awarded contracts with CFE and LyFZ that generated more than $90 million in revenues and $13 million in profits for ABB. The SEC alleges that from approximately 2000 to 2004, ABB participated in the U.N. Oil for Food Program through six subsidiaries that developed various schemes to pay secret kickbacks to the former regime in Iraq to obtain contracts under the program. ABB's Jordanian subsidiary acted as a conduit for other ABB subsidiaries by making the kickback payments on their behalf. Some of the kickbacks were made in the form of bank guarantees and cash payments. ABB improperly recorded these kickbacks on its books as legitimate payments for after sales services, consultation costs, and commissions. Oil for Food contracts obtained as a result of the kickback schemes generated $13.5 million in revenues and $3.8 million in profits for ABB. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ABB consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, orders the company to pay $17,141,474 in disgorgement, $5,662,788 in prejudgment interest, and a $16,510,000 penalty. The order also requires the company to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. Brian O. Quinn, Tracy L. Price, and Denise Hansberry conducted the SEC's investigation.

613,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged more than a dozen penny stock promoters and their companies with securities fraud for their roles in various illicit kickback schemes to manipulate the volume and price of microcap stocks and illegally generate stock sales. One of the schemes was perpetrated by an actor who starred as a police officer on the long-running television show CHiPs. The SEC worked closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the separate schemes were uncovered through FBI undercover operations conducted in such a way that no investors suffered harm. The U.S. Attorney today announced criminal charges against some of the same individuals facing SEC civil charges. According to the SEC's complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the schemes generally involved the payment of kickbacks to purportedly corrupt pension fund managers or stockbrokers, who would use their clients' accounts to purchase the publicly traded stock of microcap issuers controlled or promoted by the individuals and companies charged today. What the promoters and insiders did not know was that the people with whom they arranged these illegal transactions were actually undercover FBI agents or confidential sources participating in undercover operations. ""These corrupt promoters meticulously planned their schemes down to the last detail, except for the possibility that they were walking into an undercover operation,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This joint law enforcement effort is a stark warning to those who embark on securities fraud schemes that we may be listening and we may be watching."" Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC's Miami Regional Office, added, ""These penny stock promoters paid illicit kickbacks to people who they thought would help them profit at the expense of unsuspecting investors by manipulating the price of their stock or fraudulently selling their shares."" The SEC's complaints allege the following individuals and companies perpetrated various kickback schemes: The SEC alleges that the promoters in some of the schemes understood that they needed to disguise the kickbacks as payments to phony consulting companies, which they knew would perform no actual work. In other instances, they knew that the purported corrupt fund managers and brokers would be violating their fiduciary duties to their clients by taking part in the kickback schemes. The SEC's complaints allege the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and financial penalties against all defendants; disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against defendants that received ill-gotten gains; officer-and-director bars against the individuals who served as officers or directors of the microcap companies involved; and penny stock bars against all individual defendants. Jessica M. Weiner and Chedly C. Dumornay of the SEC's Miami Regional Office investigated the case, and James M. Carlson of the Miami office is litigating the actions.

614,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a French medical doctor and researcher with breaking securities laws by tipping a hedge fund manager with confidential information about a clinical trial that he was involved in. The SEC alleges that Yves M. Benhamou, M.D., breached his duty of confidentiality to Human Genome Science, Inc. (HGSI) when he illegally tipped non-public negative details about a clinical trial for the drug Albumin Interferon Alfa 2-a (Albuferon) ahead of a public announcement by the company. ""Whether it is news about upcoming mergers, operating results, or as in this case clinical drug trials, passing confidential information to others to give them an unfair trading advantage is illegal,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""People entrusted with confidential information, including doctors and researchers, cannot use their positions to help others game the system."" According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Benhamou was a member of the Steering Committee overseeing HGSI's clinical trial of Albuferon, a potential drug to treat Hepatitis C. Benhamou learned about two serious adverse events, including one death, occurring during the third phase of the trial. HGSI consequently decided to reduce the dosage for the patients in that arm of the trial and publicly announce the changes. The SEC alleges that Benhamou tipped material, non-public information about the trial to the hedge fund portfolio manager upon learning of each new negative development. While serving on the Steering Committee, Benhamou provided consulting services to the portfolio manager with whom he had developed a friendship over the years. The portfolio manager, based on the confidential information provided by Benhamou, ordered the sale of the entire position of HGSI stock held by six health care-related hedge funds that he co-managed (approximately 6 million shares). These sales occurred during the six-week period prior to HGSI's public announcement on Jan. 23, 2008, that it was reducing the dosage in one arm of the trial. Two million shares were sold in a block trade just before the markets closed on January 22. HGSI's share price dropped 44 percent by the end of the day on January 23. As a result of the sales, the hedge funds avoided losses of at least $30 million. Benhamou is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

617,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced sweeping settlements with global freight forwarding company Panalpina, Inc. and six other companies in the oil services industry that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials to receive preferential treatment and improper benefits during the customs process. The SEC alleges that the companies bribed customs officials in more than 10 countries in exchange for such perks as avoiding applicable customs duties on imported goods, expediting the importation of goods and equipment, extending drilling contracts, and lowering tax assessments. The companies also paid bribes to obtain false documentation related to temporary import permits for oil drilling rigs, and enable the release of drilling rigs and other equipment from customs officials. The SEC's cases were coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, and the sanctions to be paid by the companies under the settlements total $236.5 million. This is the first sweep of a particular industrial sector in order to crack down on public companies and third parties who are paying bribes abroad. ""Bribing customs officials is not only illegal but also bad for business, as the coordinated efforts of law enforcement increase the risk of detection every day,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""These companies resorted to lucrative arrangements behind the scenes to obtain phony paperwork and special favors, and they landed themselves squarely in investigators' crosshairs."" Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, added, ""This investigation was the culmination of proactive work by the SEC and DOJ after detecting widespread corruption in the oil services industry. The FCPA Unit will continue to focus on industry-wide sweeps, and no industry is immune from investigation."" Without admitting or denying the allegations, the companies agreed to settle the SEC's charges against them by paying approximately $80 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties. The companies agreed to pay fines of $156.5 million to settle the criminal proceedings with DOJ. SEC charges against six companies were filed in federal court, and one company was charged in an SEC administrative proceeding. Among the SEC's allegations: Panalpina, Inc. â A U.S. subsidiary of the Swiss freight forwarding giant Panalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd. (PWT), Panalpina is charged with paying bribes to customs officials around the world from 2002 to 2007 on behalf of its customers, some of whom are included in these settlements. Panalpina bribed customs officials in Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Russia and Kazakhstan to enable importation of goods into those countries and the provision of logistics services. The bribes were often authorized by Panalpina's customers and then inaccurately described in customer invoices as ""local processing"" or ""special intervention"" or ""special handling"" fees. Pride International, Inc. â One of the world's largest offshore drilling companies, Pride and its subsidiaries paid approximately $2 million to foreign officials in eight countries from 2001 to 2006 in exchange for various benefits related to oil services. For example, Pride's former country manager in Venezuela authorized bribes of approximately $384,000 to a state-owned oil company official to secure extensions of drilling contracts, and a French subsidiary of Pride paid $500,000 in bribes intended for a judge to influence customs litigation relating to the importation of a drilling rig. Tidewater Inc. â The New Orleans-based shipping company through a subsidiary reimbursed approximately $1.6 million to its customs broker in Nigeria from 2002 to 2007 so the broker could make improper payments to Nigerian customs officials and induce them to disregard regulatory requirements related to the importation of Tidewater's vessels. Transocean, Inc. â An international provider of offshore drilling services to oil companies throughout the world, Transocean made illicit payments from at least 2002 to 2007 through its customs agents to Nigerian government officials in order to extend the temporary importation status of its drilling rigs. Bribes also were paid to obtain false paperwork associated with its drilling rigs and obtain inward clearance authorizations for its rigs and a bond registration. GlobalSantaFe Corp. (GSF) A provider of offshore drilling services GSF made illegal payments through its customs brokers from approximately 2002 to 2007 to officials of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) to secure documentation showing that its rigs had left Nigerian waters. The rigs had in fact never moved. GSF also made other payments to government officials in Gabon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea. Noble Corporation â An offshore drilling services provider, Noble authorized payments by its Nigerian subsidiary to its custom agent to obtain false documentation from NCS officials to show export and re-import of its drilling rigs into Nigerian waters. From 2003 to 2007, Noble obtained eight temporary import permits with false documentation. Royal Dutch Shell plc â An oil company headquartered in the Netherlands, Shell and its indirect subsidiary called Shell International Exploration and Production, Inc. (SIEP) violated the FCPA by using a customs broker to make payments from 2002 to 2005 to officials at NCS to obtain preferential customs treatment related to a project in Nigeria.

The insider trading rings identified in these enforcement actions include several prominent hedge funds, high-profile hedge fund managers, Wall Street professionals such as attorneys, professional traders, and senior corporate executives. In a complaint related to SEC v. Galleon, the SEC today charged Thomas Hardin, a former managing director at a New York-based hedge fund investment adviser, Lanexa Management LLC, for insider trading in connection with two corporate takeovers and a quarterly earnings announcement. The illicit profits at Lanexa resulting from Hardin's conduct alleged in this filing exceed $950,000. In separate complaints related to SEC v. Cutillo, et al., the SEC charged Mr. Hardin as well as two other defendants, Lanexa Management LLC, and former Schottenfeld Group LLC trader Franz Tudor, for insider trading in connection with corporate acquisitions. The illicit profits alleged in these filings total approximately $715,000. ""Today's additional charges demonstrate the SEC's ongoing crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""When greed leads hedge funds and other market professionals to illegally trade on inside information, the SEC will take aggressive action."" In SEC v. Galleon, the SEC has, as of today, charged twenty-two defendants and alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds, including Galleon, a multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by defendant Raj Rajaratnam, and by other professional traders in the securities of fourteen issuers generating illicit profits totaling approximately $53 million. See Lit. Rel. Nos. 21255, 21284 and 21397. The SEC's most recent complaint related to this action, filed earlier today in federal court in Manhattan, charges Hardin with trading in the securities of Hilton, Google and Kronos based on material nonpublic information that Hardin allegedly received from Roomy Khan, an individual investor who had, herself, received such information from various sources. The SEC's complaint alleges that Khan tipped Hardin to inside information she received from a Moody's rating agency analyst, about an impending takeover of Hilton by The Blackstone Group. According to the allegations, Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also passed the information to others, who similarly traded on the information. Khan also shared with Hardin inside information she received from an employee at Market Street Partners, an investor relations consulting firm that did work for Google, about Google's Q2 2007 earnings. Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also tipped others. Finally, Khan tipped Hardin to inside information she received about the impending acquisition of Kronos by Hellman & Friedman. Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also tipped others, who traded on the information. The SEC's complaint charges Hardin with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Hardin from future violations of the antifraud provisions, ordering him to disgorge ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay financial penalties. In connection with SEC v. Cutillo, the SEC has, to date, charged thirteen defendants and alleged widespread insider trading based on material, nonpublic information misappropriated by two former lawyers at the international law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP. See Lit. Rel. Nos. 21283 and 21332. In its latest enforcement action in this matter, the SEC alleges that a Lanexa-managed hedge fund and Hardin reaped approximately $640,000 in illegal profits by insider trading based on confidential information about an impending acquisition involving 3Com Corp. The SEC also alleges that Tudor made approximately $75,000 in illicit profits by trading on material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed acquisition of Axcan Pharma Inc. According to the SEC's complaint against Lanexa Management and Hardin, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the inside information about the 3Com acquisition that was obtained by Hardin was derived from Santarlas and Cutillo, who were privy to the confidential details through their work at the international law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP. Cutillo and Santarlas allegedly tipped this inside information through another attorney to Zvi Goffer, a former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld, in exchange for kickbacks. Goffer then tipped the inside information to fellow Schottenfeld trader Gautham Shankar, who then tipped Hardin. Goffer, Shankar and Schottenfeld were among those previously charged for their roles in the insider trading rings. According to the SEC's complaint against Tudor, also filed in federal court in Manhattan, Goffer also tipped material, nonpublic information about the proposed acquisition of Axcan to Tudor. Based on the inside information, Tudor purchased shares of Axcan in two separate personal trading accounts as well as in a proprietary account at Schottenfeld. The SEC's complaints charge Lanexa Management, Hardin, and Tudor with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaints seek permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of financial penalties.

""Today's additional charges demonstrate the SEC's ongoing crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""When greed leads hedge funds and other market professionals to illegally trade on inside information, the SEC will take aggressive action."" In SEC v. Galleon, the SEC has, as of today, charged twenty-two defendants and alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds, including Galleon, a multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by defendant Raj Rajaratnam, and by other professional traders in the securities of fourteen issuers generating illicit profits totaling approximately $53 million. See Lit. Rel. Nos. 21255, 21284 and 21397. The SEC's most recent complaint related to this action, filed earlier today in federal court in Manhattan, charges Hardin with trading in the securities of Hilton, Google and Kronos based on material nonpublic information that Hardin allegedly received from Roomy Khan, an individual investor who had, herself, received such information from various sources. The SEC's complaint alleges that Khan tipped Hardin to inside information she received from a Moody's rating agency analyst, about an impending takeover of Hilton by The Blackstone Group. According to the allegations, Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also passed the information to others, who similarly traded on the information. Khan also shared with Hardin inside information she received from an employee at Market Street Partners, an investor relations consulting firm that did work for Google, about Google's Q2 2007 earnings. Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also tipped others. Finally, Khan tipped Hardin to inside information she received about the impending acquisition of Kronos by Hellman & Friedman. Hardin traded on the information on behalf of Lanexa and also tipped others, who traded on the information. The SEC's complaint charges Hardin with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Hardin from future violations of the antifraud provisions, ordering him to disgorge ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay financial penalties. In connection with SEC v. Cutillo, the SEC has, to date, charged thirteen defendants and alleged widespread insider trading based on material, nonpublic information misappropriated by two former lawyers at the international law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP. See Lit. Rel. Nos. 21283 and 21332. In its latest enforcement action in this matter, the SEC alleges that a Lanexa-managed hedge fund and Hardin reaped approximately $640,000 in illegal profits by insider trading based on confidential information about an impending acquisition involving 3Com Corp. The SEC also alleges that Tudor made approximately $75,000 in illicit profits by trading on material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed acquisition of Axcan Pharma Inc. According to the SEC's complaint against Lanexa Management and Hardin, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the inside information about the 3Com acquisition that was obtained by Hardin was derived from Santarlas and Cutillo, who were privy to the confidential details through their work at the international law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP. Cutillo and Santarlas allegedly tipped this inside information through another attorney to Zvi Goffer, a former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld, in exchange for kickbacks. Goffer then tipped the inside information to fellow Schottenfeld trader Gautham Shankar, who then tipped Hardin. Goffer, Shankar and Schottenfeld were among those previously charged for their roles in the insider trading rings. According to the SEC's complaint against Tudor, also filed in federal court in Manhattan, Goffer also tipped material, nonpublic information about the proposed acquisition of Axcan to Tudor. Based on the inside information, Tudor purchased shares of Axcan in two separate personal trading accounts as well as in a proprietary account at Schottenfeld.

624,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a pair of longtime employees at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) with playing key roles in the Madoff Ponzi scheme. One employee produced phony account statements for investors and feathered her own accounts for personal gain, while the other conspired to cash out Madoff's friends and family as the fraud collapsed in addition to creating phony account statements and tracking the Ponzi scheme bank account. The SEC alleges that Annette Bongiorno, who began working for BMIS in an administrative capacity in 1968, regularly created false books and records and helped mislead investors in telephone conversations and through account statements and trade confirmations that reported securities transactions that never happened and positions that never existed. Bongiorno also created false trades in her own BMIS accounts that enabled her to cash out millions of dollars more than she deposited. The SEC further alleges that JoAnn Crupi, who was responsible for supervising the primary bank account used in BMIS's investment advisory operations, helped facilitate the fraud and mislead investors, auditors, and regulators into believing that BMIS was a legitimate enterprise. When the fraud was on the verge of collapse, Crupi helped decide which accounts should be cashed out and prepared checks for those selected investors, many of them who were friends or family of Madoff. ""Bongiorno and Crupi helped create an elaborate edifice of fake accounts, fake trades, and fake profits,"" said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""Without their active and ongoing assistance, Madoff's world of lies would have been unsustainable."" According to the SEC's complaint against Bongiorno filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bongiorno created trades that were chosen with the benefit of hindsight to generate large ""gains"" in BMIS accounts. The trades and positions reported in investor accounts, however, were fictional. Bongiorno also fabricated trades in her own BMIS accounts, depositing approximately $920,000 into these accounts but withdrawing approximately $14.5 million. The high balances and withdrawals were made possible only through the sham, backdated, highly profitable ""trades"" that Bongiorno fabricated. According to the SEC's complaint against Crupi, also filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, she was hired in 1983 as a keypunch operator in BMIS's investment advisory operations and reported to Bongiorno. She eventually supervised some lower-level BMIS employees and worked closely with Frank DiPascali, another high-level BMIS lieutenant charged by the SEC last year. Crupi had exclusive control over two important aspects of the BMIS fraud: she handled the primary bank account used in the Ponzi scheme, and she created false trading portfolios and account statements related to a purported hedging strategy using baskets of stock for a group of limited partnership funds managed by a longtime BMIS investor. The SEC alleges that Crupi knew the true financial condition of Madoff's Ponzi scheme and its dwindling assets. On Dec. 3, 2008, DiPascali told Crupi that the scheme was on the verge of collapse, and they met shortly thereafter to discuss the implications of the collapse in more detail. Crupi continued to process client deposits during this time period, depositing approximately $59 million of client checks into the Ponzi scheme bank account from December 4 to December 12. In the final days of the fraud, when the money available to meet investor redemptions had dwindled to a few hundred million dollars, DiPascali convinced Madoff to use the remaining funds to liquidate the accounts of family and friends of the firm, including employees, and not to honor redemption requests by the larger institutional investors. Crupi helped DiPascali review BMIS investor lists and identify which accounts should be cashed out. Madoff approved these actions and Crupi prepared checks for the selected investors totaling more than $350 million. Madoff was arrested and the checks were seized before they could be distributed. The SEC's complaints against Bongiorno and Crupi specifically allege that by their actions, they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder and Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaints seek permanent injunctions, financial penalties and court orders requiring Bongiorno and Crupi to disgorge their ill-gotten gains. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with which the Commission has coordinated its investigation. The SEC's investigation is continuing. For more information about this enforcement action, contact: Andrew M. Calamari Associate Director, SEC's New York Regional Office - 212-336-0042 Alexander M.

625,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Deloitte Tax LLP partner and his wife with repeatedly leaking confidential merger and acquisition information to family members overseas in a multi-million dollar insider trading scheme. The SEC alleges that Arnold McClellan and his wife Annabel, who live in San Francisco, provided advance notice of at least seven confidential acquisitions planned by Deloitte's clients to Annabel's sister and brother-in-law in London. After receiving the illegal tips, the brother-in-law took financial positions in U.S. companies that were targets of acquisitions by Arnold McClellan's clients. His subsequent trades were closely timed with telephone calls between Annabel McClellan and her sister, and with in-person visits with the McClellans. Their insider trading reaped illegal profits of approximately $3 million in U.S. dollars, half of which was to be funneled back to Annabel McClellan. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) has announced charges against the two relatives â James and Miranda Sanders of London. The FSA also charged colleagues of James Sanders whom he tipped with the nonpublic information in the course of his work at his London-based derivatives firm. Sanders's tippees and clients made approximately $20 million in U.S. dollars by trading on the inside information. ""The McClellans might have thought that they could conceal their illegal scheme by having close relatives make illegal trades offshore. They were wrong,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""In this day and age, whether it's across oceans or across markets, the SEC and its domestic and foreign law enforcement partners are committed to identifying and prosecuting illegal insider trading."" Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""Deloitte and its clients entrusted Arnold McClellan with highly confidential information. Along with his wife, he abused that trust and used high-placed access to corporate secrets for the couple's own benefit and their family's enrichment."" According to the SEC's complaint, Arnold McClellan had access to highly confidential information while serving as the head of one of Deloitte's regional mergers and acquisitions teams. He provided tax and other advice to Deloitte's clients that were considering corporate acquisitions. The SEC alleges that between 2006 and 2008, James Sanders used the non-public information obtained from the McClellans to purchase derivative financial instruments known as ""spread bets"" that are pegged to the price of the underlying U.S. stock. The trading started modestly, with James Sanders buying the equivalent of 1,000 shares of stock in a company that Arnold McClellan's client was attempting to acquire. Subsequent deals netted significant trading profits, and eventually James Sanders was taking large positions and passing along information about Arnold McClellan's deals to colleagues and clients at his trading firm as well as to his father. Among the confidential impending transactions allegedly revealed by McClellan: The SEC's complaint alleges the following chronology involving insider trading around the Kronos transaction: The SEC's complaint charges Arnold and Annabel McClellan with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SEC's case was investigated by Victor W. Hong, Monique C. Winkler, Alice L. Jensen, and Jina L. Choi of the San Francisco Regional Office. The Commission would like to thank the UK Financial Services Authority, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Ms. McClellan agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and consented to the entry of a final judgment that enjoined her from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In a related action, the Commission requested the dismissal of the insider trading claims against Arnold McClellan, which the Court subsequently granted with prejudice.

The SEC alleges that Arnold McClellan and his wife Annabel, who live in San Francisco, provided advance notice of at least seven confidential acquisitions planned by Deloitte's clients to Annabel's sister and brother-in-law in London. After receiving the illegal tips, the brother-in-law took financial positions in U.S. companies that were targets of acquisitions by Arnold McClellan's clients. His subsequent trades were closely timed with telephone calls between Annabel McClellan and her sister, and with in-person visits with the McClellans. Their insider trading reaped illegal profits of approximately $3 million in U.S. dollars, half of which was to be funneled back to Annabel McClellan. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) has announced charges against the two relatives â James and Miranda Sanders of London. The FSA also charged colleagues of James Sanders whom he tipped with the nonpublic information in the course of his work at his London-based derivatives firm. Sanders's tippees and clients made approximately $20 million in U.S. dollars by trading on the inside information. ""The McClellans might have thought that they could conceal their illegal scheme by having close relatives make illegal trades offshore. They were wrong,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""In this day and age, whether it's across oceans or across markets, the SEC and its domestic and foreign law enforcement partners are committed to identifying and prosecuting illegal insider trading."" Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office, added, ""Deloitte and its clients entrusted Arnold McClellan with highly confidential information. Along with his wife, he abused that trust and used high-placed access to corporate secrets for the couple's own benefit and their family's enrichment."" According to the SEC's complaint, Arnold McClellan had access to highly confidential information while serving as the head of one of Deloitte's regional mergers and acquisitions teams. He provided tax and other advice to Deloitte's clients that were considering corporate acquisitions. The SEC alleges that between 2006 and 2008, James Sanders used the non-public information obtained from the McClellans to purchase derivative financial instruments known as ""spread bets"" that are pegged to the price of the underlying U.S. stock. The trading started modestly, with James Sanders buying the equivalent of 1,000 shares of stock in a company that Arnold McClellan's client was attempting to acquire. Subsequent deals netted significant trading profits, and eventually James Sanders was taking large positions and passing along information about Arnold McClellan's deals to colleagues and clients at his trading firm as well as to his father. Among the confidential impending transactions allegedly revealed by McClellan: The SEC's complaint alleges the following chronology involving insider trading around the Kronos transaction: The SEC's complaint charges Arnold and Annabel McClellan with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SEC's case was investigated by Victor W. Hong, Monique C. Winkler, Alice L. Jensen, and Jina L. Choi of the San Francisco Regional Office. The Commission would like to thank the UK Financial Services Authority, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Ms. McClellan agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and consented to the entry of a final judgment that enjoined her from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In a related action, the Commission requested the dismissal of the insider trading claims against Arnold McClellan, which the Court subsequently granted with prejudice.

627,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former information technology manager at a Delaware law firm and his brother-in-law with insider trading on confidential information about impending mergers and acquisitions by the law firmâs clients. The SEC alleges that Jeffery J. Temple, a former Information Systems and Security Manager at a Wilmington, Del.-based law firm, accessed material nonpublic information in the course of his employment and then traded in advance of at least 22 merger and acquisition public announcements involving 20 companies that retained his former employer as counsel in some capacity. Temple also tipped his brother-in-law, Benedict M. Pastro, who traded in concert with Temple in advance of twelve public announcements. The pair reaped over $182,000 in illegal profits during their insider trading scheme. Temple was terminated from his position on Oct. 11, 2010, once law enforcement authorities revealed that they had uncovered his illegal scheme. âBy virtue of his position as a law firm information systems and security manager, Temple exploited his access to confidential merger and acquisition information for his and his brother-in-lawâs benefit,â said Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the Division of Enforcementâs Market Abuse Unit. âTemple abused his position of trust and violated serious duties owed to his law firm and its clients. Law firm employees, especially those with information technology responsibilities, must safeguard confidential information entrusted to them. This is critical to maintaining investor confidence in the fairness of the markets,â Hawke added. According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the scheme began in 2009 as Temple used his IT position to access nonpublic information about impending deals involving law firm clients. Temple, who lives in Newark, Del., corresponded with his online brokerage firm using his law firm e-mail address. Electronic login records for Templeâs brokerage account reflect that he often placed trades from work. Frequent telephone calls around the time of the trades indicate that Temple closely coordinated his trading with Pastro, who also lives in Newark. Among the many deals mentioned in the complaint, the SEC alleges, for example, that Temple and Pastro conducted insider trading based on confidential information Temple accessed about an impending merger and acquisition involving DynCorp International, Inc. Templeâs law firm was hired on Oct. 6, 2009, to act as special Delaware outside counsel to Dyncorpâs Board of Directors in connection with its possible acquisition by Cerberus Capital Management L.P. Temple and Pastro purchased stock and call options in DynCorp shortly before an April 12, 2010, public merger and acquisition announcement. Immediately following the announcement, Temple and Pastro sold their positions for illicit trading profits of more than $34,000. The SEC further alleges that Temple and Pastro also traded on nonpublic information that Temple obtained about an impending deal between Facet Biotech Corporation and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. Templeâs law firm was retained as counsel to Facet on or before Aug. 25, 2009, in connection with Abbott Labsâs proposed tender offer to Facet. Temple and Pastro bought stock and call options only days before the March 9, 2010, public announcement that Facet agreed to be acquired by Abbott Labs. Pastro and Temple sold all of their positions immediately after the announcement for combined trading profits of more than $23,000. The SEC also alleges that Temple was trading on material nonpublic information obtained during the course of his employment and profiting from his scheme as recently as September. Finally, the SEC alleges that Temple and Pastro violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SECâs Market Abuse Unit headed by Chief Daniel M. Hawke and Deputy Chief Sanjay Wadhwa conducted the investigation out of the agencyâs Philadelphia Regional Office. Philadelphia-based Market Abuse Unit staff who worked on the investigation included Colleen K. Lynch, Lynn H. OâConnor and John S. Rymas under the leadership of Associate Regional Director Elaine C. Greenberg. G. Jeffrey Boujoukos and Catherine A. Pappas are handling the litigation.

628,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Jonathan Star Bristol, attorney for former financial advisor Kenneth Ira Starr, with aiding and abetting Starr's multi-million dollar fraud by allowing Starr to use his attorney trust accounts as conduits when Starr stole money from advisory clients. The SEC alleges that more than $25 million belonging to Starr's clients flowed through Bristol's attorney trust accounts. Without his clients' authorization, Starr would transfer their funds into the attorney trust accounts, and then Bristol would transfer the stolen funds to Starr and his two companies for personal use. The SEC alleges that Bristol never disclosed the existence of the attorney trust accounts to the prominent international law firm where he worked at the time. Monthly account statements clearly listing the names of Starr's clients as the source of the incoming transfers were sent directly to Bristol's home address instead of the law firm. Meanwhile, Bristol touted his relationship with Starr to his colleagues and others, claiming that Starr managed $70 billion in assets. In fact, Starr managed only a fraction of that amount. ""Bristol had a legal and professional responsibility not to assist Ken Starr in conduct that he knew was unlawful,"" said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""Bristol crossed the line from lawyer to conspirator when he failed to safeguard funds entrusted to him, helped Starr steal client money, and lied to the victims to perpetuate the scheme."" The SEC previously charged Starr, Starr Investment Advisors LLC, and Starr & Company LLC with violating securities laws pertaining to custody of clients' assets and misusing client funds to buy a multi-million dollar luxury condominium on Manhattan's Upper East Side among other things. The SEC's amended complaint, filed today in federal court in Manhattan, adds Bristol as a defendant, alleging that beginning around November 2008 and continuing until Starr's arrest in May 2010, Bristol repeatedly allowed Starr to use his attorney trust accounts to funnel money stolen from Starr clients. Notwithstanding his personal role in the scheme, Bristol represented Starr and his companies throughout the SEC's investigation and in an investment advisory examination by SEC staff. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Bristol was confronted by one of Starr's victims about an unauthorized $1 million transfer from the victim's account. Bristol lied to the victim that the funds were being bundled with other clients' funds for an investment with UBS Financial Services. In fact, Bristol had already used the misappropriated funds to pay a multi-million dollar legal settlement with one of Starr's former clients. Bristol subsequently sought to represent that same victim after the victim was contacted by SEC staff in its investigation. In addition to the fact that such representations violated the ethical obligations of lawyers, Bristol's clear intent was to obstruct and undermine the SEC's investigation in order to conceal the wrongdoing. The SEC's amended complaint charges Bristol with aiding and abetting the Starr Parties' violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with pre-judgment interest and financial penalties. The SEC also will seek an order barring Bristol from practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Sanjay Wadhwa, Maureen F. Lewis, Timothy Casey and Sandeep Satwalekar, all members of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit in New York, and George O'Kane of the New York Regional Office conducted the agency's investigation, which is continuing.

629,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Paris-based telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to foreign government officials to illicitly win business in Latin America and Asia. The SEC alleges that Alcatelâs subsidiaries used consultants who performed little or no legitimate work to funnel more than $8 million in bribes to government officials in order to obtain or retain lucrative telecommunications contracts and other contracts. Alcatel agreed to pay more than $45 million to settle the SECâs charges, and pay an additional $92 million to settle criminal charges announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice. âAlcatel and its subsidiaries failed to detect or investigate numerous red flags suggesting their employees were directing sham consultants to provide gifts and payments to foreign government officials to illegally win business,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAlcatelâs bribery scheme was the product of a lax corporate control environment at the company.â Glenn S. Gordon, Associate Director for Enforcement in the SECâs Miami Regional Office, added, âThe serious sanctions Alcatel has agreed to, including paying back all net profits made on the contracts Alcatel illegally obtained, should serve as a reminder that we are committed to enforcing the FCPA and a level playing field for companies seeking to obtain or retain business in other countries.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in the Southern District of Florida, Alcatelâs bribes went to government officials in Costa Rica, Honduras, Malaysia, and Taiwan between December 2001 and June 2006. An Alcatel subsidiary provided at least $14.5 million to consulting firms through sham consulting agreements for use in the bribery scheme in Costa Rica. Various high-level government officials in Costa Rica received at least $7 million of the $14.5 million to ensure Alcatel obtained or retained three contracts to provide telephone services in Costa Rica. The SEC alleges that the same Alcatel subsidiary bribed officials in the government of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications contracts. Another Alcatel subsidiary made bribery payments to Malaysian government officials in order to procure a telecommunications contract. An Alcatel subsidiary also made illegal payments to various officials in the government of Taiwan to win a contract to supply railway axle counters to the Taiwan Railway Administration. According to the SECâs complaint, all of the bribery payments were undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting fees in the books of Alcatelâs subsidiaries and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial statements. The leaders of several Alcatel subsidiaries and geographical regions, including some who reported directly to Alcatelâs executive committee, either knew or were severely reckless in not knowing about the misconduct. The SECâs complaint charges that Alcatel violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making illicit payments to foreign government officials, through its subsidiaries and agents, in order to obtain or retain business. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books and records. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act when its subsidiaries knowingly failed to implement a system of internal controls and knowingly falsified their books and records to camouflage bribes as consulting payments. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Alcatel has consented to a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of these statutory provisions; ordering the company to pay $45.372 million in disgorgement of wrongfully obtained profits, and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings including an independent monitor for a three-year term.

632,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged additional individuals and entities in its SEC v. Galleon insider trading case, including a New York hedge fund advisory firm, its hedge fund manager, an analyst at the hedge fund, a senior corporate executive in the technology sector, and an investor relations firm employee. The SEC alleges that Robert Feinblatt â a co-founder and principal of New York-based hedge fund investment adviser Trivium Capital Management LLC â and Trivium analyst Jeffrey Yokuty engaged in insider trading in the securities of Polycom, Hilton, Google and Kronos. The SEC further alleges that Polycom senior executive Sunil Bhalla and Shammara Hussain, an employee at investor relations consulting firm Market Street Partners that did work for Google, tipped the inside information that enabled the insider trading by Feinblatt and Yokuty on behalf of Trivium's hedge funds for illicit profits of more than $15 million. ""Today's action reveals disturbingly corrupt arrangements â faithless company executives who secretly pass corporate information to hedge fund managers willing to violate the law for profit,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Market participants need to understand that by engaging in such behavior they invite SEC scrutiny, and we will uncover their conduct and take aggressive action."" The SEC has now charged 27 defendants in its SEC v. Galleon enforcement action that has alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds including Galleon â a multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by Raj Rajaratnam â and by other professional traders in the securities of 14 companies generating illicit profits totaling approximately $69 million. In the SEC's complaint filed earlier today in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Feinblatt and Yokuty traded on behalf of Trivium in connection with two corporate takeovers and two quarterly earnings announcements based on material nonpublic information that Feinblatt and Yokuty allegedly received from Roomy Khan, an individual investor who herself received such information from various sources. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bhalla tipped Khan to inside information about Polycom's 2005 fourth quarter earnings, and Khan traded on that information and tipped others. The tippees included Feinblatt and Yokuty, who traded on behalf of Trivium based on the information. Bhalla also tipped Khan with inside information about Polycom's 2006 first quarter earnings. Khan traded on the information and tipped Rajaratnam, who traded on behalf of Galleon based on the inside information. The SEC also alleges that Khan traded on and tipped Feinblatt and Yokuty among others with inside information that she received from a Moody's rating agency analyst about an impending takeover of Hilton by The Blackstone Group. Feinblatt and Yokuty then traded on behalf of Trivium based on the inside information. The SEC further alleges that Hussain tipped Khan among others with inside information about Google's 2007 second quarter earnings. Khan traded on the information and also tipped Feinblatt and Yokuty, who traded on behalf of Trivium based on the inside information. The SEC also alleges that Khan traded on and tipped Feinblatt and Yokuty among others with inside information that she received about the impending acquisition of Kronos by Hellman & Friedman. Feinblatt and Yokuty then traded on behalf of Trivium based on the inside information. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, except for Bhalla, with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Bhalla from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company.

The SEC also charged CSIM and Schwab Investments with deviating from the YieldPlus fund's concentration policy without obtaining the required shareholder approval. The SEC also filed a complaint in federal court against CSIM's former chief investment officer for fixed income Kimon Daifotis as well as Schwab official Randall Merk, who is an executive vice president at CS&Co. and was president of CSIM and a trustee of the YieldPlus and other Schwab funds. The SEC alleges that Daifotis and Merk committed fraud and other securities law violations in connection with the offer, sale and management of the YieldPlus Fund. CSIM and CS&Co. agreed to pay more than $118 million to settle the SEC's charges. The SEC's case continues against the executives. Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement said, ""All financial firms and professionals â including large mutual fund providers â must be vigilant in accurately describing the risks of the products they sell to the public, especially the widely-held mutual funds that are the bread-and-butter investments of retail investors."" Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Schwab marketed the fund as a cash alternative with only slightly more risk than a money market fund even though, at one point, half of the fund's assets were invested in private-issuer, mortgage-backed and other securities with maturities and credit quality that were significantly different than investments made by money market funds."" The YieldPlus Fund is an ultra-short bond fund that, at its peak in 2007, had $13.5 billion in assets and more than 200,000 accounts, making it the largest ultra-short bond fund in the category. The fund suffered a significant decline during the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008. Its assets fell from $13.5 billion to $1.8 billion during an eight-month period due to redemptions and declining asset values. According to an administrative order issued by the SEC against the Schwab entities and the SEC's related complaints against the entities and the two executives filed in federal court in San Francisco, they failed to inform investors adequately about the risks of investing in the YieldPlus Fund. For example, they described the fund as a cash alternative that had only slightly higher risk than a money market fund. The statements were misleading because the fund was more than slightly riskier than money market funds, and the Schwab entities and Merk and Daifotis did not adequately inform investors about the differences between YieldPlus and money market funds. The SEC found that the YieldPlus Fund deviated from its concentration policy when it invested more than 25 percent of fund assets in private-issuer mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Mutual funds and other registered investment companies are required to state certain investment policies in their SEC filings, including a policy regarding concentration of investments. Once established, a fund may not deviate from its concentration policy without shareholder approval. Schwab's bond funds, including the YieldPlus Fund and the Total Bond Market Fund, had a policy of not concentrating more than 25 percent of assets in any one industry, including private-issuer MBS. The funds violated this policy, and the Investment Company Act, by investing approximately 50 percent of the assets of the YieldPlus Fund and more than 25 percent of the Total Bond Fund's assets in private-issuer MBS without obtaining shareholder approval. According to the SEC's order and complaints, the YieldPlus Fund's NAV began to decline and many investors redeemed their holdings as the credit crisis unfolded in mid-2007. Unlike a money market fund, few of the fund's assets were scheduled to mature within the next several months. As a result, the fund had to sell assets in a depressed market to raise cash. While the YieldPlus Fund's NAV declined, CSIM, CS&Co., Merk, and Daifotis held conference calls, issued written materials, and had other communications with investors that contained a number of material misstatements and omissions concerning the fund. For example, in two conference calls, Daifotis made false and misleading statements that the fund was experiencing ""very, very, very slight"" and ""minimal"" investor redemptions. In fact, Daifotis knew that YieldPlus had experienced more than $1.2 billion in redemptions during the two weeks prior to the calls, which caused YieldPlus to sell more than $2.1 billion of its securities. Similarly, Merk authored, reviewed and approved misleading statements about the fund, such as a false claim that the fund had a ""short maturity structure"" that ""mitigated much of the price erosion"" experienced by its peers. The SEC also found that CSIM and CS&Co. did not have policies and procedures reasonably designed â given the nature of their businesses â to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information about the fund. For example, they did not have specific policies and procedures governing redemptions by portfolio managers who advised Schwab funds of funds, and did not have appropriate information barriers concerning nonpublic and potentially material information about the fund. As a result, several Schwab-related funds and individuals were free to redeem their own investments in YieldPlus during the fund's decline. Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC's order or the allegations in the SEC's complaint, CSIM and CS&Co. agreed to pay a total of $118,944,996, including $52,327,149 in disgorgement of fees by CSIM, a $52,327,149 penalty against CSIM, a $5 million penalty against CS&Co., and pre-judgment interest of $9,290,698. Some of CSIM's disgorgement may be deemed satisfied up to a maximum of $26,944,996 for payments made within the next 60 days to settle related investigations by FINRA or state securities regulators. The SEC seeks to have payments placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors, and the related recoveries by other regulators, such as FINRA, may be contributed to the Fair Fund. The payments and any Fair Fund are subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. CSIM, CS&Co. and Schwab Investments also consented to an SEC order requiring them to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC order also requires them to comply with certain undertakings, including correction of all disclosures regarding the funds' concentration policy. In addition, the Commission censured CSIM and CS&Co., and required them to retain an independent consultant to review and make recommendations about their policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information. In its order, the Commission found that: The SEC's complaint against Daifotis and Merk alleges violations and aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Investment Advisers Act, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, and other violations, including Sections 13(a) and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act. Melissa Hodgman, David Mendel and Robert Cohen in the SEC's Division of Enforcement conducted the investigation. The SEC's litigation against the executives will be led by David Gottesman and Frederick Block. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter.

634,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three affiliated New York-based investment firms and four former senior officers with fraud, misuse of client assets, and other securities laws violations involving their $66 million advisory business. The SEC alleges that the operationâs investment adviser William Landberg and president Kevin Kramer â through the firms West End Financial Advisors LLC (WEFA), West End Capital Management LLC (WECM), and Sentinel Investment Management Corporation â misled investors into believing that their money was in stable, safe investments designed to provide steady streams of income. However, in reality West End faced deepening financial problems stemming from Landbergâs failed investment strategies. When starved for cash to meet obligations of the West End funds or for his personal needs, Landberg misused investor assets, fraudulently obtained more than $8.5 million from a bank, and used millions of dollars from an interest reserve account for unauthorized purposes. The SEC also charged West Endâs chief financial officer Steven Gould and controller Janis Barsuk for their roles in the scheme. âThe investment advisers here grossly abused the trust of their clients,â said George S. Canellos, Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âThey misappropriated and commingled their clientsâ assets and sustained the illusion of a viable and successful business through a range of false representations.â David Rosenfeld, Associate Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office, added, âWest End raised millions from investors by touting false positive returns while concealing fraudulent bank loans, cash flow problems, and the misappropriation of investor assets.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the misconduct occurred from at least January 2008 to May 2009. The SEC alleges that Landberg used substantial amounts of fraudulently-obtained bank loans to make distributions to certain West End fund investors, thereby sustaining the illusion that West Endâs investments were performing well. During the same period, Landberg also misappropriated at least $1.5 million for himself and his family. Landbergâs wife Louise Crandall and their family partnership are named as relief defendants in the SECâs complaint. The SEC further alleges that Gould and Barsuk knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Landberg was defrauding a bank that provided loans to a West End fund by misusing funds in a related interest reserve account. Both officers nevertheless participated in the fraud by facilitating Landbergâs misappropriations from that account. The SEC alleges that Gould conceived and used improper accounting methods to conceal aspects of the fraud, and he issued account statements to investors showing false investment returns. Barsuk facilitated Landbergâs uses of investor money to cover his personal obligations. Similarly, Kramer knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that West End faced severe financial problems and had difficulty obtaining sufficient financing to sustain its investment strategy. Nevertheless, Kramer failed to disclose those material facts to investors as he continued to market the funds to new and existing investors through April 2009. The SEC charged Landberg, Kramer, Gould, WEFA, WECM, and Sentinel with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, Landberg, WEFA, WECM, and Sentinel are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Kramer, Gould, and Barsuk are charged with aiding and abetting violations of the Advisers Act. Barsuk is also charged with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks to enjoin each defendant from future violations of the securities laws as well as monetary relief, the imposition of an independent monitor, and certain other sanctions. The SECâs case was investigated by Ken C. Joseph, Matthew J. Watkins, and Cynthia A. Matthews of the SECâs New York Regional Office, with assistance from Alistaire Bambach.

635,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former chief executive officer at Innospec, Inc., with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by approving bribes to government officials to obtain and retain business. The SEC alleges that Paul W. Jennings learned of the company's longstanding practice of paying bribes to win orders for sales of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in mid- to late 2004 while serving as the CFO. After becoming CEO in 2005, Jennings and others in Innospec's management approved bribery payments to officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (MoO) in order to sell the fuel additive to Iraq refineries. Innospec used its third-party agent in Iraq to funnel payments to Iraqi officials. Jennings agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him. The SEC previously charged Innospec as well as its former TEL business director and its agent in Iraq with FCPA violations. ""This is the third enforcement action against an individual responsible for the widespread bribery that occurred at Innospec,"" said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ""We will vigorously hold accountable those individuals who approve such bribery and who sign false SOX certifications and other documents to cover up the wrongdoing."" According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Jennings played a key role in Innospec's bribery activities in Iraq and Indonesia. Innospec, a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and other specialty chemicals, was charged last year for making illicit payments of approximately $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials in exchange for contracts worth approximately $176 million. The SEC alleges that Innospec made payments totaling more than $1.6 million and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials. For example, in an October 2005 e-mail copying Jennings, the agent said that Iraqi officials were demanding a 2 percent kickback and that ""[w]e are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards."" The kickback and later payments were paid by increasing the agent's commission, which Jennings approved. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Jennings was aware of the scheme to pay an official at the Trade Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit. Another scheme involved a bribe to ensure the failure of a field test of a competitor product. A confidential MoO report for the field trial test was shared with Jennings. Bribes were offered to secure a 2008 Long Term Purchase Agreement that would have caused approximately $850,000 to be shared with Iraqi officials. The agreement, however, did not go forward due to the investigation and ultimate discovery by U.S. regulators of widespread bribery by Innospec. According to the SEC's complaint, Innospec also paid bribes to Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 to 2005 in order to win contracts worth more than $48 million from state-owned oil and gas companies in Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved payments beginning in mid to late 2004. Various euphemisms to refer to the bribery were commonly used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings and others at Innospec, including ""the Indonesian Way,"" ""the Lead Defense Fund,"" and ""TEL optimization."" Bribery discussions were held on a flight in the U.S. and even discussed at Jennings' performance review in 2005. In one bribery scheme with Pertamina, an Indonesian state owned oil and gas company, Innospec agreed, with approval by Jennings, to a ""one off payment"" of $300,000 to their Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it would be passed on to an Indonesian official. The SEC's complaint also alleges that from 2004 to February 2009, Jennings signed annual certifications that were provided to auditors where he falsely stated that he had complied with Innospec's Code of Ethics incorporating the Company's FCPA policy. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which he made false certifications concerning the company's books and records and internal controls. Jennings has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Innospec's violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)(B). Jennings will disgorge $116,092 plus prejudgment interest of $12,945, and pay a penalty of $100,000 that takes into consideration Jennings's cooperation in this matter. Tracy L. Price and Denise Hansberry of the SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA Unit conducted the investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.K.'s SFO in this matter. The SEC's investigation is continuing.

636,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated with securities fraud for misusing customer order information to place proprietary trades for the firm and for charging customers undisclosed trading fees. To settle the SEC's charges, Merrill has agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and consent to a cease-and-desist order. ""Investors have the right to expect that their brokers won't misuse their order information,"" said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The conduct here was clearly inappropriate. Merrill's proprietary traders had improper access to information about the firm's customer orders, and misused it to place trades on the firm's behalf."" The SEC's order found that Merrill operated a proprietary trading desk between 2003 and 2005 that was known as the Equity Strategy Desk (ESD), which traded securities solely for the firm's own benefit and had no role in executing customer orders. The ESD was located on Merrill's main equity trading floor in New York City, where traders on Merrill's market making desk received and executed customer orders. While Merrill represented to customers that their order information would be maintained on a strict need-to-know basis, the firm's ESD traders obtained information about institutional customer orders from traders on the market making desk. They then used it to place trades on Merrill's behalf after executing the customers' trades. In doing so, Merrill misused this information and acted contrary to its representations to customers. The SEC's order also found that, between 2002 and 2007, Merrill had agreements with certain institutional and high net worth customers that Merrill would only charge a commission equivalent for executing riskless principal trades. However, in some instances, Merrill also charged customers undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs by filling customer orders at prices less favorable to the customer than the prices at which Merrill purchased or sold the securities in the market. ""Charging these undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs was improper and contrary to Merrill's agreements with its customers,"" said Robert B. Kaplan, Co-Chief of the SEC's Asset Management Unit. ""Brokers must act honestly and transparently when charging fees to their customers. There is no place in our markets for charging investors undisclosed trading fees."" Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Merrill consented to the entry of a Commission order that censures Merrill, requires it to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 15(c)(1)(A), 15(g), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(6) thereunder, and orders it to pay a penalty of $10 million. In determining to accept Merrill's offer, the Commission considered certain remedial actions undertaken by Merrill after it was acquired by Bank of America. Brian O.

637,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained a court order freezing the assets of a Stamford, Conn.-based investment adviser and its principal, Francisco Illarramendi, charging that they misappropriated at least $53 million in investor funds and used the money for self-dealing transactions. The SEC alleges that Illarramendi defrauded investors in the several hedge funds he managed by improperly transferring their money into bank accounts that he personally controlled. He then invested the money for his own benefit or for the benefit of the entities that he controlled, rather than for the benefit of the hedge fund investors. âIllarramendi treated his clientsâ money like it was his own, diverting millions of dollars that did not belong to him,â said David P. Bergers, Director of the SECâs Boston Regional Office. âHe abused his position of trust with his clients and breached his responsibilities as an investment adviser.â According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut on January 14, Illarramendi is the majority owner of the Michael Kenwood Group LLC â a holding company for, among other entities, investment adviser Michael Kenwood Capital Management LLC. Through this adviser entity, Illarramendi manages several hedge funds, including one that contains up to $540 million in assets. The SECâs complaint alleges that Illarramendi took at least $53 million in investor money out of this hedge fund without the knowledge or consent of the hedge fundâs investors The SEC sought an asset freeze and other emergency relief because it alleged that Illarramendi was imminently planning to make additional investments using investor funds without the knowledge or consent of the investors. Since the filing of the complaint, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, has held a series of hearings pertaining to the SECâs request for an emergency relief against Illarramendi and Michael Kenwood Capital Management. Judge Arterton then entered an order freezing the assets of the defendants. The SEC's complaint charges Illarramendi and Michael Kenwood Capital Management, LLC, with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint also names the following Illarramendi-controlled entities as relief defendants, alleging that they received investor funds to which they have no right: Michael Kenwood Asset Management LLC, Michael Kenwood Energy and Infrastructure LLC, and MKEI Solar LP. In addition to preliminary emergency relief, the SECâs complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties from the defendants, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest from the relief defendants.

Longoria shared this inside information with multiple PGR clients who, in turn, traded in AMD securities. From January 2008 to March 2010, Longoria received more than $130,000 for talking to PGR and its clients. DeVore, a Global Supply Manager at Dell, was privy to confidential information about Dell's internal sales forecasts as well as information about the pricing and volume of Dell's purchases from its suppliers. DeVore regularly provided PGR and PGR clients with this inside information so it could be used to trade securities.

In its amended complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that four hedge fund portfolio managers and analysts received illegal tips from the expert network consultants and then caused their hedge funds to trade on the inside information. âIt is illegal for company insiders who moonlight as consultants to sell confidential information about their companies to traders, and it is equally illegal to buy that corruptly obtained information and trade on it,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âInstead of competing on a level playing field with other investors, these hedge fund managers sought to illegally trade today on what others would not learn until tomorrow.â The SECâs ongoing investigation is focusing on the activities of expert networks that purportedly provide professional investment research to their clients. While it is legal to obtain expert advice and analysis through expert networking arrangements, it is illegal to trade on material nonpublic information obtained in violation of a duty to keep that information confidential. The technology company insiders who tipped the confidential information were expert network consultants to the firm Primary Global Research LLC (PGR). The SECâs amended complaint alleges: Samir Barai of New York, N.Y., the founder and portfolio manager of Barai Capital Management, obtained inside information about several technology firms from company insiders, and then traded on the inside information on behalf of Barai Capital. Jason Pflaum of New York, N.Y., a former technology analyst at Barai Capital Management, obtained inside information about technology companies and shared it with Barai. After Pflaum shared the confidential information with him, Barai used it to illegally trade on behalf of Barai Capital. Noah Freeman of Boston, Mass., a former managing director at a Boston-based hedge fund, obtained inside information regarding Marvell and shared it with Donald Longueuil of New York, N.Y., a former managing director at a Connecticut-based hedge fund. Longueuil caused his hedge fund to trade on the inside information. Freeman also obtained inside information about another technology company and caused his hedge fund to trade on the nonpublic information. The SECâs amended complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and additionally charges Barai, Pflaum, Freeman and Longueuil with aiding and abetting othersâ violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Barai, Pflaum and Barai Capital with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. Sanjay Wadhwa, Jason Friedman, Joseph Sansone, Daniel Marcus â members of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit in New York â have conducted the SECâs investigation with Matthew Watkins, Neil Hendelman, Diego Brucculeri and James DâAvino of the New York Regional Office.

641,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tyson Foods Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by making illicit payments to two Mexican government veterinarians responsible for certifying its Mexican subsidiaryâs chicken products for export sales. The SEC alleges that Tyson de Mexico initially concealed the improper payments by putting the veterinariansâ wives on its payroll while they performed no services for the company. The wives were later removed from the payroll and payments were then reflected in invoices submitted to Tyson de Mexico by one of the veterinarians for âservices.â Tyson de Mexico paid the veterinarians a total of $100,311. It was not until two years after Tyson Foods officials first learned about the subsidiaryâs illicit payments that its counsel instructed Tyson de Mexico to cease making the payments. Tyson Foods agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle the SECâs charges and resolve related criminal proceedings announced today by the Department of Justice. âTyson and its subsidiary committed core FCPA violations by bribing government officials through no-show jobs and phony invoices, and by having a lax system of internal controls that failed to detect or prevent the misconduct,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the scheme occurred during fiscal years 2004 to 2006. In order to export products, meat-processing facilities in Mexico must obtain certification through an inspection program administered by Mexicoâs federal government and supervised by an office in the Mexican Department of Agriculture. Tyson de Mexico participated in the program in order to export goods to Japan and other countries. The two veterinarians involved were responsible for certifying Tyson de Mexicoâs chicken products for export and served as official Mexican government veterinarians at Tyson de Mexicoâs facilities. The SECâs complaint alleges that a Tyson de Mexico plant manager discovered the wives on the payroll in June 2004 and informed a Tyson Foods accountant of the situation. After subsequent meetings involving Tyson Foods and Tyson International officials, the payroll payments to the veterinariansâ wives were replaced with invoice payments to one of the veterinarians. An executive of Tyson International approved this approach. The SEC alleges that in connection with these improper payments, Tyson Foods failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to implement a system of effective internal controls to prevent the salary payments to phantom employees and the payment of illicit invoices. The improper payments were improperly recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de Mexicoâs books and records and included in Tyson de Mexicoâs reported financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Tyson de Mexicoâs financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson Foodsâ consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC for those years. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Tyson Foods consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest of more than $1.2 million and permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval. In a related criminal information filed today, the Department of Justice charged Tyson Foods with conspiring to violate the FCPA and violating the FCPA. DOJ and Tyson Foods agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. Tyson Foods has agreed to pay a $4 million criminal penalty. The SECâs case was investigated by Allen Flood and Conway Dodge of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. The SEC acknowledges the cooperation of Tyson Foods in the investigation. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

642,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former senior executives at IndyMac Bancorp with securities fraud for misleading investors about the mortgage lenderâs deteriorating financial condition. The SEC alleges that former CEO Michael W. Perry and former CFOs A. Scott Keys and S. Blair Abernathy participated in the filing of false and misleading disclosures about the financial stability of IndyMac and its main subsidiary, IndyMac Bank F.S.B. The three executives regularly received internal reports about IndyMacâs deteriorating capital and liquidity positions in 2007 and 2008, but failed to ensure adequate disclosure of that information to investors as IndyMac sold millions of dollars in new stock. IndyMac Bank was a federally-chartered thrift institution regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and headquartered in Pasadena, Calif. The OTS closed the bank on July 11, 2008, and placed it under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receivership. IndyMac filed for bankruptcy protection later that month. âThese corporate executives made false and misleading disclosures about IndyMac at a time when the companyâs financial condition was rapidly deteriorating. Truthful and accurate disclosure to investors is particularly critical during a time of crisis, and the federal securities laws do not become optional when the news is negative,â said Lorin L. Reisner, Deputy Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. According to the SECâs complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Perry and Keys defrauded new and existing IndyMac shareholders by making false and misleading statements about IndyMacâs financial condition in its 2007 annual report and in offering materials for the companyâs sale of $100 million in new stock to investors. In early February 2008, IndyMac projected that it would return to profitability and continue to pay preferred dividends in 2008 without having to raise new capital. In late February 2008, Perry and Keys knew that contrary to the rosy projections released just two weeks earlier, IndyMac had begun raising new capital to protect IndyMacâs capital and liquidity positions. Specifically, Perry and Keys regularly received information that IndyMacâs financial condition was rapidly deteriorating and authorized new stock sales as a result. Yet they fraudulently failed to fully disclose IndyMacâs precarious financial condition in the 2007 annual report and the offering documents for the new stock sales. The SEC further alleges that Perry knew that rating downgrades in April 2008 on bonds held by IndyMac Bank had exacerbated its capital and liquidity positions to the extent that IndyMac had no choice but to suspend future preferred dividend payments by no later than May 2, 2008. This material information was not disclosed in IndyMacâs ongoing stock offerings. Perry also failed to disclose in various SEC filings or a May 2008 earnings conference call that IndyMac would not have been âwell-capitalizedâ at the end of its first quarter without departing from its traditional method for risk-weighting subprime assets and backdating an $18 million capital contribution. According to the SECâs complaint, Abernathy replaced Keys as IndyMacâs CFO in April 2008. He similarly made false and misleading statements in the offering documents used in selling new IndyMac stock to investors despite regularly receiving internal reports about IndyMacâs deteriorating capital and liquidity positions. The SEC also alleges that in summer 2007 while serving as IndyMacâs executive vice president in charge of specialty lending, Abernathy made false and misleading statements about the quality of the loans in six IndyMac offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) totaling $2.5 billion. Abernathy received internal reports each month revealing that 12 to 18 percent of IndyMacâs loans contained misrepresentations regarding important loan and borrower characteristics. However, the RMBS offering documents stated that nothing had come to IndyMacâs attention that any loan included in the offering contained a misrepresentation. The SEC alleges that Abernathy failed to ensure that the quality of IndyMacâs loans was accurately disclosed and failed to disclose that information had come to IndyMacâs attention about loans containing misrepresentations. Abernathy agreed to settle the SECâs charges without admitting or denying the allegations. He consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and requires him to pay a $100,000 penalty, $25,000 in disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of $1,592.26. Abernathy also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SECâs Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant. He has the right to apply for reinstatement after two years. The SECâs complaint charges Perry and Keys with knowingly violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting IndyMacâs violations of its periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. Perry also is charged with aiding and abetting IndyMacâs reporting violations under Exchange Act Rules 13a-11 and 13a-13. The SECâs complaint against Perry and Keys seeks permanent injunctive relief, an officer and director bar, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty.

643,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former treasurer of the one-time largest non-depository mortgage lender in the country with aiding and abetting a $1.5 billion securities fraud scheme and an attempt to scam the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The SEC alleges that Desiree E. Brown, the former treasurer of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (TBW), helped enable the sale of more than $1.5 billion in fictitious and impaired mortgage loans and securities from TBW to Colonial Bank, and caused them to be falsely reported to the investing public as high-quality, liquid assets. Brown also helped cause Colonial Bank to misrepresent that it had satisfied a prerequisite necessary to qualify for TARP funds. The SEC previously charged former TBW chairman and majority owner Lee B. Farkas in June 2010. Farkas also was arrested in June by criminal authorities. In a related action today, Brown pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice in the Eastern District of Virginia. ""Brown willingly participated with Farkas in a $1.5 billion fraud on Colonial Bank and its investors,"" said Lorin L. Reisner, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Brown also aided efforts by Farkas to mislead Colonial Bank and its regulators regarding the bank's application for TARP funds."" According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Brown and Farkas perpetrated the fraudulent scheme from March 2002 to August 2009, when Colonial Bank was seized by regulators and Colonial BancGroup and TBW both filed for bankruptcy. TBW was the largest customer of Colonial Bank's Mortgage Warehouse Lending Division (MWLD). Because TBW generally did not have sufficient capital to internally fund the mortgage loans it originated, it relied on financing arrangements primarily through Colonial Bank's MWLD to fund such mortgage loans. The SEC alleges that when TBW began to experience liquidity problems and overdrew its then-limited warehouse line of credit with Colonial Bank by approximately $15 million each day, Brown and Farkas and an officer of Colonial Bank concealed the overdraws through a pattern of ""kiting"" in which certain debits were not entered until after credits due for the following day were entered. In order to conceal this initial fraudulent conduct, Brown, Farkas and the Colonial Bank officer created and submitted fictitious loan information to Colonial Bank and created fictitious mortgage-backed securities assembled from the fraudulent loans. By the end of 2007, the scheme consisted of approximately $500 million in fake residential mortgage loans and approximately $1 billion in severely impaired residential mortgage loans and securities. These fictitious and impaired loans were misrepresented as high-quality assets on Colonial BancGroup's financial statements. The SEC alleges that in addition to causing Colonial BancGroup to misrepresent its assets, Brown assisted Farkas in causing BancGroup to misstate publicly that it had obtained commitments for a $300 million capital infusion that would qualify Colonial Bank for TARP funding. In fact, Farkas and Brown never secured financing or sufficient investors to fund the capital infusion. When BancGroup issued a press release announcing it had obtained preliminary approval to receive $550 million in TARP funds, its stock price jumped 54 percent - its largest one-day price increase since 1983. When BancGroup and TBW later mutually announced the termination of their stock purchase agreement and signaled the end of Colonial Bank's pursuit of TARP funds, BancGroup's stock declined 20 percent. The SEC's complaint charges Brown with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violation of Rule 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The proposed preliminary settlement, under which the SEC's requests for financial penalties against Brown would remain pending, is subject to court approval. The SEC's case was investigated by M. Graham Loomis, Aaron W. Lipson, Yolanda L. Ross and Barry R. Lakas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the TARP, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Civil Division.

644,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a hedge fund investment advisory firm and its two founders with orchestrating a multi-faceted scheme to defraud clients and failing to comply with fiduciary obligations. The SEC alleges that Eugenio Verzili and Arturo Rodriguez through their firm Juno Mother Earth Asset Management LLC misappropriated client assets, inflated assets under management, and filed false information with the SEC. Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez looted approximately $1.8 million of assets from a hedge fund they manage, misusing it to pay Junoâs operating costs related to payroll, rent, travel, meals, and entertainment. They issued promissory notes to conceal a substantial portion of their misappropriation. Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez also misrepresented the amount of capital that some Juno partners had invested in one of its funds, claiming they had invested millions of dollars when they actually had invested nothing in the funds. âVerzili, Rodriguez and their firm violated the most fundamental duties of an investment adviser by lying to their clients and misappropriating the money entrusted to their care,â said George S. Canellos, Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âThey compounded their wrongdoing by providing false information in filings with the SEC that are designed to ensure that registered investment advisers make full disclosure to investors.â Bruce Karpati, Co-Chief of the Asset Management Unit in the SECâs Division of Enforcement, said, âHedge fund investors derive comfort from knowing the fundâs adviser has so-called âskin in the gameâ by investing its own money side-by-side with investors and sharing the same risks and rewards. These managers deliberately distorted their skin in the game.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Juno sold securities in client brokerage and commodity accounts and directed 41 separate transfers of cash to Junoâs bank account, claiming falsely that the transfers were reimbursements for expenses Juno had incurred on behalf of the client fund. Verzili and Rodriguez later fabricated and issued nine promissory notes to make it appear that the client fund had invested the money in Juno. But they concealed the so-called investment from the independent directors of the client fund. The SECâs complaint further alleges that Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez marketed investments in the Juno-advised fund and failed to disclose Junoâs precarious financial condition to investors. They also failed to disclose that Juno owed a client fund a minimum of $1.2 million, which represented the proceeds of the promissory notes. While offering and selling securities in the client fund, Juno repeatedly inflated and misrepresented the amount of assets that Juno managed and claimed at one point that Juno had as much as $200 million under management. Verzili also represented falsely to investors that Junoâs partners had up to $3 million of their own capital invested in a client fund. Junoâs partners had never actually invested any of their own money. The SEC alleges that Juno filed false Forms ADV with the SEC in order to avoid deregistration with the Commission, claiming in those filings that Juno managed $40 million more than it actually did. Verzili and Rodriguez also caused Juno to provide a number of false filings to the SEC that failed to disclose that Juno had engaged in principal transactions with its client and had custody of client assets. The SECâs complaint charges Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as additional regulatory-based violations of the Advisers Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and monetary penalties. The SECâs case was investigated by New York Regional Office staff including Ken C. Joseph and Mark D. Salzberg of the Asset Management Unit and Elzbieta Wraga, with assistance from examiners Eugenio Cantiello, Majid Mahmood, Raymond Slezak and Joseph DiMaria.

645,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three senior executives at Akron, Ohio-based Fair Finance Company with orchestrating a $230 million fraudulent scheme involving at least 5,200 investors â many of them elderly. The SEC alleges that after purchasing Fair Finance Company, chief executive officer Timothy S. Durham, chairman James F. Cochran, and chief financial officer Rick D. Snow deceived investors while selling them interest-bearing certificates. Fair Finance had previously operated for decades as a privately-held consumer finance company. But under the guise of loans, Durham and Cochran schemed to divert investor proceeds to themselves and others as well as struggling and unprofitable entities that they controlled. Durham and Cochran further misused investor funds to buy classic cars and other luxury items to enhance their own lavish lifestyles. In a parallel criminal proceeding, the U.S. Department of Justice today unsealed criminal charges against Durham, Cochran and Snow for the same alleged misconduct. âThese executives looted Fair Finance and exploited unsuspecting investors who trusted the company to prudently invest their funds as it had done for decades,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âTo add insult to injury, they squandered the stolen funds on such extravagances as multiple homes, a private jet, a yacht and more than 40 classic and exotic cars.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Fair Finance historically raised funds by selling interest-bearing certificates to investors and using the proceeds to purchase and service discounted consumer finance contracts. Following the 2002 purchase, Durham and Cochran funneled millions of dollars to themselves and their related companies. By November 2009, Durham, Cochran and their related businesses owed Fair Finance more than $200 million, which accounted for approximately 90 percent of Fair Financeâs total loan portfolio. The SEC alleges that Durham and Cochran knew that neither they nor their related companies had the earnings, collateral or other resources to ensure repayment on the purported loans. As CFO, Snow knew or was reckless in not knowing that neither Durham and Cochran nor their entities could repay the funds they took from Fair Finance. Nonetheless, they continued to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from investors by using false and misleading financial statements and other information contained in the offering circulars to deceive investors about Fair Financeâs true financial condition. Ultimately, Durham, Cochran and their related companies never repaid these loans, and they used new investor proceeds to repay earlier investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. Durham and Cochran also distributed large amounts of money to family members and friends, and misused investor funds to afford mortgages for multiple homes, a $3 million private jet, a $6 million yacht, and classic and exotic cars worth more than $7 million. They also diverted investor money to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in gambling and travel expenses, credit card bills, and country club dues, and to pay for elaborate parties and other forms of entertainment. According to the SECâs complaint, Durham has residences in Los Angeles and Fortville, Ind.; Cochran resides in McCordsville, Ind.; and Snow lives in Fishers, Ind. Durham currently is the CEO at National Lampoon, and Snow currently is the CFO. The SECâs complaint charges Durham, Cochran and Snow with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties and officer and director bars against each of the defendants.

646,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chemist with insider trading on confidential information about upcoming announcements of FDA drug approval decisions, generating more than $3.6 million in illicit profits and avoided losses. The SEC alleges that Cheng Yi Liang illegally traded in advance of at least 27 public announcements about FDA drug approval decisions involving 19 publicly traded companies. Some announcements concerned the FDAâs approval of new drugs while others concerned negative FDA decisions. In each instance, he traded in the same direction as the announcement. Liang went to great lengths to conceal his insider trading. He traded in seven brokerage accounts, none of which were in his name. One belonged to his 84-year-old mother who lives in China. In a parallel action, criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice against Liang were unsealed today. âLiang victimized both the investors who were disadvantaged by his theft of inside information and the American citizens whose trust he violated by placing private gain above public good,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit, added, âThe insider trading laws apply to employees of the federal government just as they do to Wall Street traders, corporate insiders, or hedge fund executives. Many government agencies like the FDA routinely possess and generate confidential market-moving information. Federal employees who misappropriate such information to engage in insider trading risk exposing themselves to potential civil and criminal charges for violating the federal securities laws.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division), Liang works in the FDAâs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Beginning as early as July 2006, Liang purchased shares for a profit before 19 positive announcements regarding FDA decisions, shorted stock for a profit before six negative announcements, and sold shares to avoid losses before two negative announcements. For example, the SEC alleges that Liang traded in advance of an FDA announcement approving Clinical Dataâs application for the drug Viibryd. Liang accessed a confidential FDA database that contained critical documents and information about the FDAâs review of Clinical Dataâs application, and then used that information to purchase more than 46,000 shares of Clinical Data at a cost of more than $700,000. After the markets closed on Friday, Jan. 21, 2011, the FDA issued a press release approving Viibryd. Clinical Dataâs stock price rose by more than 67 percent the following Monday and Liang sold his entire Clinical Data position in less than 15 minutes for a profit of approximately $380,000. The SEC alleges that Liang used the trading profits for his own personal benefit. Checks totaling at least $1.2 million were written from the accounts he used for trading to a bank account in his name, to him or his wife directly, or to credit card companies to pay off balances in accounts in his or his wifeâs name. Nearly $65,000 worth of checks were written from the brokerage accounts to car dealerships to purchase vehicles later registered to Liang and his wife. The SECâs complaint alleges that Liang violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of unlawful trading profits and losses avoided plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty. The SECâs complaint names Liangâs wife Yi Zhuge and the account holders for the seven trading accounts he used â Liangâs mother Hui Juan Chen, his son Andrew Liang, Shuhua Zhu, Zhongshan Chen, and Honami Toda â as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten funds to which they have no legitimate claim. Criminal charges by the Department of Justice against Andrew Liang were unsealed today in the District of Maryland. The SECâs investigation was conducted by Deborah Tarasevich, Carolyn Welshhans, Owen Granke, and Ricky Sachar â members of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit in Washington, D.C. The SECâs litigation effort will be led by Matthew Martens and David Williams. The SEC thanks the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Maryland for their ongoing assistance in this matter.

In a parallel action, criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice against Liang were unsealed today. âLiang victimized both the investors who were disadvantaged by his theft of inside information and the American citizens whose trust he violated by placing private gain above public good,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit, added, âThe insider trading laws apply to employees of the federal government just as they do to Wall Street traders, corporate insiders, or hedge fund executives. Many government agencies like the FDA routinely possess and generate confidential market-moving information. Federal employees who misappropriate such information to engage in insider trading risk exposing themselves to potential civil and criminal charges for violating the federal securities laws.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division), Liang works in the FDAâs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Beginning as early as July 2006, Liang purchased shares for a profit before 19 positive announcements regarding FDA decisions, shorted stock for a profit before six negative announcements, and sold shares to avoid losses before two negative announcements. For example, the SEC alleges that Liang traded in advance of an FDA announcement approving Clinical Dataâs application for the drug Viibryd. Liang accessed a confidential FDA database that contained critical documents and information about the FDAâs review of Clinical Dataâs application, and then used that information to purchase more than 46,000 shares of Clinical Data at a cost of more than $700,000. After the markets closed on Friday, Jan. 21, 2011, the FDA issued a press release approving Viibryd. Clinical Dataâs stock price rose by more than 67 percent the following Monday and Liang sold his entire Clinical Data position in less than 15 minutes for a profit of approximately $380,000. The SEC alleges that Liang used the trading profits for his own personal benefit. Checks totaling at least $1.2 million were written from the accounts he used for trading to a bank account in his name, to him or his wife directly, or to credit card companies to pay off balances in accounts in his or his wifeâs name. Nearly $65,000 worth of checks were written from the brokerage accounts to car dealerships to purchase vehicles later registered to Liang and his wife. The SECâs complaint alleges that Liang violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of unlawful trading profits and losses avoided plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty. The SECâs complaint names Liangâs wife Yi Zhuge and the account holders for the seven trading accounts he used â Liangâs mother Hui Juan Chen, his son Andrew Liang, Shuhua Zhu, Zhongshan Chen, and Honami Toda â as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten funds to which they have no legitimate claim. Criminal charges by the Department of Justice against Andrew Liang were unsealed today in the District of Maryland. The SECâs investigation was conducted by Deborah Tarasevich, Carolyn Welshhans, Owen Granke, and Ricky Sachar â members of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit in Washington, D.C. The SECâs litigation effort will be led by Matthew Martens and David Williams. The SEC thanks the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Maryland for their ongoing assistance in this matter.

648,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a corporate attorney and a Wall Street trader with insider trading in advance of at least 11 merger and acquisition announcements involving clients of the law firm where the attorney worked. The SEC alleges that Matthew H. Kluger, who formerly worked at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, and Garrett D. Bauer did not have a direct relationship with each other, but were linked only through a mutual friend who acted as a middleman to facilitate the illegal scheme. Kluger and Bauer communicated with the middleman using public telephones and prepaid disposable mobile phones in order to avoid detection. According to the SECâs complaint, Kluger accessed information on 11 mergers and acquisitions involving the law firmâs clients and then tipped the middleman. In at least nine instances, the middleman passed the information on to Bauer, who illegally traded for illicit profits totaling nearly $32 million. In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey today announced the arrests of Kluger and Bauer. âThey plotted to fly under law enforcement radar by using disposable phones to hide their communications, cash withdrawals to obscure the flow of tainted money, and a middleman to conceal Kluger as the secret source of inside information,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âNow, those same schemes and devices serve only to make it clear beyond any doubt that Kluger and Bauer were involved in an illegal scheme.â Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit and Director of its Philadelphia Regional Office, added âThis was a brazen and deplorable scheme in which Kluger, a lawyer, repeatedly abused his access to confidential client information. As this and recent cases demonstrate, the Division of Enforcement is working aggressively to root out and identify hard-to-detect insider trading by connecting patterns of trading to sources of material non-public information - whether those sources are law firms or others who are under a duty to keep such information confidential.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., Kluger, Bauer and the middleman deliberately structured their communications and trading so that Kluger and the middleman could share in the insider trading proceeds while Bauer could illegally trade and profit without being connected to Kluger as a possible source of information. Bauer withdrew cash from his bank accounts and kicked back hundreds of thousands of dollars to the middleman, who in turn delivered at least $500,000 to Kluger for his role in the scheme. According to the SECâs complaint, over the past five years Kluger accessed and then tipped confidential information in advance of the following 11 mergers and acquisitions between April 2006 and March 2011: The acquisition of Advanced Digital Information Corp. by Quantum Corp., announced May 2, 2006.

652,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Johnson and Johnson (J&J) with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing public doctors in several European countries and paying kickbacks to Iraq to illegally obtain business. The SEC alleges that since at least 1998, subsidiaries of the New Brunswick, N.J.-based pharmaceutical, consumer product, and medical device company paid bribes to public doctors in Greece who selected J&J surgical implants, public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland who awarded contracts to J&J, and public doctors in Romania to prescribe J&J pharmaceutical products. J&J subsidiaries also paid kickbacks to Iraq to obtain 19 contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. J&J agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying more than $48.6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. J&J also agreed to pay a $21.4 million fine to settle parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) today. A resolution of a related investigation by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office is anticipated. âThe message in this and the SECâs other FCPA cases is plain â any competitive advantage gained through corruption is a mirage,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. âJ&J chose profit margins over compliance with the law by acquiring a private company for the purpose of paying bribes, and using sham contracts, off-shore companies, and slush funds to cover its tracks.â Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, added, âBribes to public doctors can have a detrimental effect on the public health care systems that potentially pay more for products procured through greed and corruption.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, public doctors and administrators in Greece, Poland, and Romania who ordered or prescribed J&J products were rewarded in a variety of ways, including with cash and inappropriate travel. J&J subsidiaries, employees and agents used slush funds, sham civil contracts with doctors, and off-shore companies in the Isle of Man to carry out the bribery. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, J&J has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; ordering it to pay $38,227,826 in disgorgement and $10,438,490 in prejudgment interest; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. J&J voluntarily disclosed some of the violations by its employees and conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine the scope of the bribery and other violations, including proactive investigations in more than a dozen countries by both its internal auditors and outside counsel. J&Jâs internal investigation and its ongoing compliance programs were essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of J&Jâs FCPA violations. Kelly G. Kilroy and Tracy L.

653,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former hedge fund portfolio manager with insider trading in a bio-pharmaceutical company based on confidential information about negative results of the companyâs clinical drug trial. The SEC alleges that Dr. Joseph F. âChipâ Skowron, a former portfolio manager for six health care-related hedge funds affiliated with FrontPoint Partners LLC, sold hedge fund holdings of Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI) based on a tip he received unlawfully from a medical researcher overseeing the drug trial. HGSIâs stock fell 44 percent after it publicly announced negative results from the trial of Albumin Interferon Alfa 2-a (Albuferon), and the hedge funds avoided at least $30 million in losses. The SEC previously charged the medical researcher â Dr. Yves M. Benhamou â who illegally tipped Skowron with the non-public information and received envelopes of cash in return according to the SECâs amended complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan to additionally charge Skowron. The hedge funds, which have been charged as relief defendants in the SECâs amended complaint, have agreed to pay $33 million to settle the charges. âItâs a prescription for an SEC enforcement action to illegally trade on confidential clinical trial information from doctors and other purported consultants,â said Lorin L. Reisner, Deputy Director of the SECâs Enforcement Division. Cheryl Scarboro, Chief of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âSkowron attempted to game the markets and buy the silence of his tipper. His sale of his hedge fundsâ entire position in HGSI stock before the announcement of negative news is precisely the sort of conduct that telegraphs insider trading.â In a parallel action today, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Skowron. According to the SECâs amended complaint, Benhamou served on the Steering Committee overseeing HGSIâs trial for Albuferon, a potential drug to treat Hepatitis C. While serving on the Steering Committee, Benhamou provided consulting services to Skowron through an expert networking firm. But over time, he and Skowron developed a friendship. By April 2007, many of their communications were independent of the expert networking firm. Benhamou tipped Skowron with material, non-public information about the trial as he learned of negative developments that occurred during Phase 3 of the trial. The SEC alleges that Skowron acted on confidential information he received from Benhamou prior to the public announcement and ordered the sale of the entire position in HGSI stock â approximately six million shares held by the six health-care related funds that Skowron co-managed. These sales occurred during the six-week period prior to HGSIâs public announcement. Skowron caused the hedge funds to sell two million shares in a block trade just before the markets closed Jan. 22, 2008. Changes to the trial resulting from the negative developments were announced publicly on January 23. When HGSIâs share price dropped 44 percent by the end of that day, the hedge funds avoided losses of at least $30 million. According to the SECâs amended complaint, Skowron gave Benhamou an envelope of containing 5,000 Euros while they were attending a medical conference in Barcelona, Spain in April 2007. The cash was in appreciation for Benhamouâs work as a consultant. In February 2008, after the illegal HGSI trades were completed, Skowron asked Benhamou to lie about his communications with Skowron, which he did. In late February 2008, Skowron met Benhamou in Boston and attempted to hand him a bag containing cash in appreciation for his tips on the Albuferon trial and his continued silence. Benhamou refused the cash. However, while attending a medical conference in Milan, Italy in April 2008, Skowron gave Benhamou another envelope containing at least $10,000 in cash that Benhamou accepted. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Skowron and Benhamou. Simultaneous with the filing of the SECâs amended complaint, the six hedge funds named as relief defendants agreed to settle with the Commission and pay disgorgement of $29,017,156.00 plus prejudgment interest of $4,003,669.00 without admitting or denying the allegations. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval. Suzanne J. Romajas is leading the SECâs litigation. Matthew L. Skidmore and Deborah A. Tarasevich and C. Joshua Felker conducted the SECâs investigation.

654,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS) with fraudulently rigging at least 100 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 36 states and generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. To settle the SECâs charges, UBS has agreed to pay $47.2 million that will be returned to the affected municipalities. UBS and its affiliates also agreed to pay $113 million to settle parallel cases brought by other federal and state authorities. When investors purchase municipal securities, the municipalities generally temporarily invest the proceeds of the sales in reinvestment products before the money is used for the intended purposes. Under relevant IRS regulations, the proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities must generally be invested at fair market value. The most common way of establishing fair market value is through a competitive bidding process in which bidding agents search for the appropriate investment vehicle for a municipality. The SEC alleges that during the 2000 to 2004 time period, UBSâs fraudulent practices and misrepresentations undermined the competitive bidding process and affected the prices that municipalities paid for the reinvestment products being bid on by the provider of the products. Its fraudulent conduct at the time also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted. The business unit involved in the misconduct closed in 2008 and its employees are no longer with the company. According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, UBS played various roles in these tainted transactions. UBS illicitly won bids as a provider of reinvestment products, and also rigged bids for the benefit of other providers while acting as a bidding agent on behalf of municipalities. UBS at times additionally facilitated the payment of improper undisclosed amounts to other bidding agents. In each instance, UBS made fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions, thereby deceiving municipalities and their agents. âOur complaint against UBS reads like a âhow-toâ primer for bid-rigging and securities fraud,â said Elaine C. Greenberg, Chief of the SECâs Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. âThey used secret arrangements and multiple roles to win business and defraud municipalities through the repeated use of illegal courtesy bids, last looks for favored bidders, and money to bidding agents disguised as swap payments.â According to the SECâs complaint, UBS as a bidding agent steered business through a variety of mechanisms to favored bidders acting as providers of reinvestment products. In some cases, UBS gave a favored provider information on competing bids in a practice known as âlast looks.â In other instances, UBS deliberately obtained off-market âcourtesyâ bids or arranged âset-upsâ by obtaining purposefully non-competitive bids from others so that the favored provider would win the business. UBS also transmitted improper, undisclosed payments to favored bidding agents through interest rate swaps. In addition, UBS was favored to win bids with last looks and set-ups as a provider of reinvestment products. In a related enforcement action, the SEC barred former UBS officer Mark Zaino from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser, based upon his guilty plea last year in a criminal case charging him with two counts of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for engaging in misconduct in the competitive bidding process involving the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Commission recognizes Zainoâs cooperation in the SECâs investigation as well as investigations conducted by other law enforcement agencies. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, UBS has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. UBS has agreed to pay a penalty of $32.5 million and disgorgement of $9,606,543 with prejudgment interest of $5,100,637. The settlement is subject to court approval. This is the SECâs second settlement with a major bank in an ongoing investigation into corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry. In December 2010, the SEC charged Banc of America Securities LLC (BAS) with securities fraud for similar conduct. In that matter, BAS agreed to pay more than $36 million in disgorgement and interest to settle the SECâs charges, and paid an additional $101 million to other federal and state authorities for its misconduct. The SECâs investigation was conducted by Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter. The SEC is bringing this enforcement action in coordination with the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service and 25 State Attorneys General. The SECâs investigation is continuing.

655,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Monticello, N.Y.-based investment adviser with fraudulently offering and selling securities in two upstate New York real estate funds he managed. The SEC alleges that Lloyd V. Barriger told investors in the Gaffken & Barriger Fund (G&B Fund) that it was a relatively safe and liquid investment that generated a minimum return of 8 percent per year. However, the fundâs actual performance did not justify these performance claims. The SEC further alleges that Barriger defrauded investors in Campus Capital Corp. by raising money from them to prop up the ailing G&B Fund without disclosing that was how their money was actually being used. Barriger also caused Campus to engage in other transactions that personally benefitted him, unbeknownst to Campus investors. âIn the midst of the credit crisis, Barriger chose to lie about the solvency and liquidity of his fund rather than admit the somber truth of a collapsing business,â said George Canellos, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. âHe continued to solicit new investor funds based on the same misrepresentations up until the day before the fund collapsed.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the G&B Fund raised approximately $20 million from January 1998 to March 2008, and Campus raised approximately $12 million from October 2001 to July 2008. Barriger froze the G&B Fund in March 2008 and disclosed its true financial condition to investors. The SECâs complaint alleges that Barriger misused G&B Fund assets by causing the fund to pay cash distributions of âPreferred Returnsâ to those investors who requested them. Barriger also caused the fund to redeem investors at values reflecting the purported accrued 8 percent per year return when the fund lacked the income to support those allocations and payments. According to the SECâs complaint, Barriger caused Campus to inject a total of nearly $2.5 million into the G&B Fund between August 2007 and April 2008 when the G&B Fund was in distress. Barriger did not disclose this information to investors. The SECâs complaint alleges that Barriger violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In its complaint, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Barriger from future violations of the foregoing provisions and ordering him to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.

656,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former managing director of The NASDAQ Stock Market with insider trading on confidential information that he stole while working in a market intelligence unit that communicates with companies in advance of market-moving public announcements. The SEC alleges that Donald L. Johnson traded in advance of such public announcements as corporate leadership changes, earnings reports and forecasts, and regulatory approvals of new pharmaceutical products. He often placed the illegal trades directly from his work computer through an online brokerage account in his wifeâs name. Johnson obtained illicit trading profits of more than $755,000 during a three-year period. Johnson also has been charged in a parallel criminal action announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. âThis case is the insider trading version of the fox guarding the henhouse,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âInstead of protecting NASDAQ client confidences, Johnson secretly traded on client information for personal gain, even using his NASDAQ office computer to make the trades.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Johnson illegally traded in advance of nine announcements involving NASDAQ-listed companies from August 2006 to July 2009. Johnson took advantage of both favorable and unfavorable information that was entrusted to him in confidence by NASDAQ and its listed company clients, shorting stocks on several occasions and establishing long positions in other instances. Johnson lives in Ashburn, Va., and worked in various positions for the NASD and NASDAQ for 20 years until his retirement from NASDAQ in September 2009. According to the SECâs complaint, Johnson worked in NASDAQâs Corporate Client Group (CCG) from January 2000 to October 2006. He then transferred to the Market Intelligence Desk, a specialized department within the CCG that provides issuers with general market updates, overviews of their companyâs sector, and commentary regarding the factors influencing day-to-day trading activity in their stocks. The SEC alleges that Johnson had frequent and significant interactions with senior executives of NASDAQ-listed issuers, including CEOs, CFOs, and investor relations officers at his assigned companies. The corporate executives who shared nonpublic information with Johnson did so based on the understanding that it would be kept confidential and that Johnson could not use the information for his personal benefit. For example, the SEC alleges that Johnson obtained illicit profits of approximately $175,000 by insider trading in the stock of United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR). Johnson spoke by phone with executives at UTHR including the CFO and general counsel on Oct. 30, 2007, and he became aware of the successful completion of a trial for its drug Viveta (later renamed Tyvaso). Despite the nonpublic and highly confidential nature of the Viveta trial results discussed with him, Johnson purchased 10,000 shares of UTHR stock in his wifeâs brokerage account on October 31. After UTHR issued a press release on November 1 announcing the successful trial results, Johnson began selling all of the stock that he had purchased the day before, placing sell orders online from his office computer at NASDAQ. The SECâs complaint charges Johnson with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest and a monetary penalty. Johnsonâs wife Dalila Lopez is named as a relief defendant in the SECâs complaint for the purpose of recovering illicit profits in her possession.

658,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will pay $153.6 million to settle SEC charges that it misled investors in a complex mortgage securities transaction just as the housing market was starting to plummet. Under the settlement, harmed investors will receive all of their money back. In settling the SECs fraud charges against the firm, J.P. Morgan also agreed to improve the way it reviews and approves mortgage securities transactions. The SEC alleges that J.P. Morgan structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) without informing investors that a hedge fund helped select the assets in the CDO portfolio and had a short position in more than half of those assets. As a result, the hedge fund was poised to benefit if the CDO assets it was selecting for the portfolio defaulted. The SEC separately charged Edward S. Steffelin, who headed the team at an investment advisory firm that the deals marketing materials misleadingly represented had selected the CDOs portfolio. J.P Morgan marketed highly-complex CDO investments to investors with promises that the mortgage assets underlying the CDO would be selected by an independent manager looking out for investor interests, said Robert Khuzami, Director of the Division of Enforcement. What J.P. Morgan failed to tell investors was that a prominent hedge fund that would financially profit from the failure of CDO portfolio assets heavily influenced the CDO portfolio selection. With todays settlement, harmed investors receive a full return of the losses they suffered. According to the SECs complaint against J.P. Morgan filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the CDO known as Squared CDO 2007-1 was structured primarily with credit default swaps referencing other CDO securities whose value was tied to the U.S. residential housing market. Marketing materials stated that the Squared CDOs investment portfolio was selected by GSCP (NJ) L.P.  the investment advisory arm of GSC Capital Corp. (GSC)  which had experience analyzing CDO credit risk. Omitted from the marketing materials and unknown to investors was the fact that the Magnetar Capital LLC hedge fund played a significant role in selecting CDOs for the portfolio and stood to benefit if the CDOs defaulted. The SEC alleges that by the time the deal closed in May 2007, Magnetar held a $600 million short position that dwarfed its $8.9 million long position. In an internal e-mail, a J.P. Morgan employee noted, We all know [Magnetar] wants to print as many deals as possible before everything completely falls apart. The SEC alleges that in March and April 2007, J.P. Morgan knew it faced growing financial losses from the Squared deal as the housing market was showing signs of distress. The firm then launched a frantic global sales effort in March and April 2007 that went beyond its traditional customer base for mortgage securities. The J.P. Morgan employee in charge of Squareds global distribution said in a March 22, 2007, e-mail that we are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-barrel to move around.  Let's schedule the cesarian (sic), please! By 10 months later, the securities had lost most or all of their value. According to the SECs complaint, J.P. Morgan sold approximately $150 million of so-called mezzanine notes of the Squared CDOs liabilities to more than a dozen institutional investors who lost nearly their entire investment. These investors included: Without admitting or denying the allegations, J.P. Morgan consented to a final judgment that provides for a permanent injunction from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and payment of $18.6 million in disgorgement, $2 million in prejudgment interest and a $133 million penalty. Of the $153.6 million total, $125.87 million will be returned to the mezzanine investors through a Fair Fund distribution, and $27.73 million will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. The settlement also requires J.P. Morgan to change how it reviews and approves offerings of certain mortgage securities. In addition, J.P. Morgans consent notes that it voluntarily paid $56,761,214 to certain investors in a transaction known as Tahoma CDO I. The settlement is subject to court approval. In a separate complaint filed against Steffelin, who headed the team at GSC responsible for the Squared CDO, the SEC alleges that Steffelin allowed Magnetar to select and short portfolio assets. The complaint alleges that Steffelin drafted and approved marketing materials promoting GSCs selection of the portfolio without disclosing Magnetars role in the selection process. In addition, unknown to investors, Steffelin was seeking employment with Magnetar while working on the transaction. The SECs complaint charges Steffelin with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, and penalties against Steffelin. Separately, GSCs bankruptcy trustee has consented to the entry of an administrative order requiring the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 204 and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. GSC is in bankruptcy, and its settlement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court.

Morgan sold approximately $150 million of so-called mezzanine notes of the Squared CDOs liabilities to more than a dozen institutional investors who lost nearly their entire investment. These investors included: Without admitting or denying the allegations, J.P. Morgan consented to a final judgment that provides for a permanent injunction from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and payment of $18.6 million in disgorgement, $2 million in prejudgment interest and a $133 million penalty. Of the $153.6 million total, $125.87 million will be returned to the mezzanine investors through a Fair Fund distribution, and $27.73 million will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. The settlement also requires J.P. Morgan to change how it reviews and approves offerings of certain mortgage securities. In addition, J.P. Morgans consent notes that it voluntarily paid $56,761,214 to certain investors in a transaction known as Tahoma CDO I. The settlement is subject to court approval. In a separate complaint filed against Steffelin, who headed the team at GSC responsible for the Squared CDO, the SEC alleges that Steffelin allowed Magnetar to select and short portfolio assets. The complaint alleges that Steffelin drafted and approved marketing materials promoting GSCs selection of the portfolio without disclosing Magnetars role in the selection process. In addition, unknown to investors, Steffelin was seeking employment with Magnetar while working on the transaction. The SECs complaint charges Steffelin with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, and penalties against Steffelin. Separately, GSCs bankruptcy trustee has consented to the entry of an administrative order requiring the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 204 and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. GSC is in bankruptcy, and its settlement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court. The SECs investigation was conducted by the Enforcement Divisions Structured and New Products Unit led by Kenneth Lench and Reid Muoio. The SEC investigative attorneys were Carolyn Kurr, Jason Anthony, Jeffrey Leasure, and Brent Mitchell. The SEC trial attorneys that will handle the litigation against Steffelin are Matt Martens, Jan Folena, and Robert Dodge.

661,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) with fraudulently rigging at least 93 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 31 states, generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. To settle the SECâs fraud charges, JPMS agreed to pay approximately $51.2 million that will be returned to the affected municipalities or conduit borrowers. JPMS and its affiliates also agreed to pay $177 million to settle parallel charges brought by other federal and state authorities. âJPMS improperly won bids by entering into secret arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal 'last look' at competitorsâ bids,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. âMunicipal issuers and investors didn't stand a chance against the fraudulent strategies JPMS and others used to guarantee profits."" Elaine C. Greenberg, Chief of the SEC's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, added, âWhen powerful financial institutions like JPMS conspire with each other to intentionally violate regulations designed to ensure fair investment prices, the integrity of the municipal marketplace becomes corrupted. Rather than playing by the rules, the rules got played.â Typically, when investors purchase municipal securities, the municipalities temporarily invest the proceeds of the sales in municipal reinvestment products until the money is used for the intended purposes. Under relevant Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, the proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities generally must be invested at fair market value. The most common way of establishing fair market value is through a competitive bidding process in which bidding agents search for the appropriate investment vehicle for a municipality. The SEC alleges that from 1997 through 2005, JPMSâs fraudulent practices, misrepresentations and omissions undermined the competitive bidding process, affected the prices that municipalities paid for reinvestment products, and deprived certain municipalities of a conclusive presumption that the reinvestment instruments had been purchased at fair market value. JPMSâs fraudulent conduct also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted. The employees involved in the alleged misconduct are no longer with the company. According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, JPMS, acting as the agent for its affiliated commercial bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at times won bids because it obtained information from the bidding agents about competing bids, a practice known as âlast looks.â In other instances, it won bids set up in advance for JPMS to win (âset-upsâ) because the bidding agent deliberately obtained non-winning bids from other providers, and it facilitated bids rigged for others to win by deliberately submitting non-winning bids. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, JPMS has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has agreed to pay a penalty of $32.5 million and disgorgement of $11,065,969 with prejudgment interest of $7,620,380. The settlement is subject to court approval. In a related enforcement action, the SEC barred former JPMS vice president and marketer James L. Hertz from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any penny stock offering. This sanction is based on Hertzâs December 6, 2010 guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for engaging in misconduct in connection with the competitive bidding process involving the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Commission recognizes Hertzâs cooperation in the SECâs investigation and investigations conducted by other law enforcement agencies. This is the SECâs third settlement with a financial institution stemming from its ongoing investigation into corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry. On December 7, 2010, the SEC charged Banc of America Securities LLC (BAS) with securities fraud for similar conduct. BAS agreed to pay more than $36 million in disgorgement and interest to settle the SECâs charges, and paid an additional $101 million to other federal and state authorities for its misconduct. On May 4, 2011, the SEC charged UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS) with securities fraud for fraudulently rigging bids as both a provider and a bidding agent. UBS agreed to pay $47.2 million in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties to settle the SECâs charges and to pay $113 million to other federal and state authorities in connection with their parallel cases. Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office, conducted the SECâs investigation into this matter. The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter. The SEC is bringing this enforcement action in coordination with the Department of Justice, the IRS, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and 25 State Attorneys General.

662,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a California man with insider trading for a 3000 percent profit based on confidential information that he learned from his girlfriend prior to Walt Disney Companyâs acquisition of Marvel Entertainment. The SEC alleges that Toby G. Scammell, who worked at an investment fund at the time, purchased highly speculative Marvel call options beginning in mid-August 2009. He secretly used money in his brotherâs accounts over which he had been given control when his brother was deployed to serve in Iraq a few years earlier. Just before Scammell purchased many of the Marvel securities, he searched the Internet for such terms as âinsider trading,â âmaterial, non-public information,â and âRule 10b-5.â According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Scammellâs girlfriend worked on the Marvel acquisition as an extern in Disneyâs corporate strategy department, and she possessed confidential details about the pricing and timing of the deal. Scammell illegally traded on this non-public information in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his girlfriend. Marvelâs stock price jumped more than 25 percent after the Aug. 31, 2009, public announcement, and Scammell then sold all of his Marvel options. He didnât reveal his trades or profits to his brother or his girlfriend. âScammell exploited his romantic relationship for a financial windfall. His misuse of confidential information gave him an unfair and illegal edge over other traders in the markets,â said Rosalind R. Tyson, Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office.â¬âª According to the SECâs complaint, Scammell and his girlfriend often discussed her work projects at Disney. Scammell lived with his girlfriend in her Los Angeles apartment in late July 2009 when the Marvel deal heated up at Disney and his girlfriend was assigned to work on it. She explained to Scammell in an e-mail that she could not tell him the name of the company involved because of âconfidentiality,â but she noted that âitâs very recognizable and nothing Iâve mentioned before.â According to the SECâs complaint, Scammell and his girlfriend had multiple discussions about whether she should delay her business school applications so that she could write about the high-profile acquisition she was working on at Disney as part of her business school applications. She worked long hours on the Marvel acquisition â sometimes from home â in the five weeks leading up to the deal. She received detailed information about the anticipated acquisition including the $50 per share acquisition price. Scammell had access and the password to his girlfriendâs Blackberry on occasion. The SEC alleges that Scammell obtained the identity of the acquisition target from his girlfriend by overhearing one or more of her Marvel-related conversations, seeing electronic or paper documents in her possession related to the Marvel acquisition, or through his own work-related conversations with her. For instance, when Scammellâs girlfriend learned that the acquisition would be announced by Labor Day, she informed him the timing of the announcement would allow them to attend her friendâs wedding. It was around this time that Scammell began searching the Internet regarding call options. According to the SECâs complaint, Scammell had never before traded in Marvel securities, and had only one previous experience trading call options that was unsuccessful. In the weeks leading up to the Disney-Marvel announcement, Scammell made several purchases totaling more than $5,400 in Marvel call options with remarkable strike prices of $50 and $45 even though Marvel had never traded above $41.74. Most of the Marvel options that Scammell purchased were set to expire on September 19, just weeks after the announcement. Scammellâs trades were so unusual that his purchase of options represented 100 percent of the market in many instances. After the public announcement that Marvel would be acquired by Disney, Scammell sold his Marvel options for a profit of more than $192,000 â a 3000 percent return in less than a month. The SECâs complaint alleges that Scammell had limited personal funds at the time, so he secretly used his older brotherâs money to buy the majority of the Marvel call options. Scammell had obtained trading authority over his brotherâs account when he was deployed to serve in Iraq with the U.S. Army. Scammell never told his brother that he had invested his money in Marvel or that his brotherâs account had increased by more than $100,000 in less than one month as a result of the Marvel trades. The SECâs complaint alleges that Scammell, who now lives in Greenbrae, Calif., violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SECâs investigation was conducted by Teri M. Melson in the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the litigation effort will be led by Spencer E. Bendell. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority.

663,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Goldman, Sachs & Co. employee and his father with insider trading on confidential information about Goldmanâs trading strategies and intentions that he learned while working on the firmâs exchange-traded funds (ETF) desk. The SECâs Division of Enforcement alleges that Spencer D. Mindlin obtained non-public details about Goldmanâs plans to purchase and sell large amounts of securities underlying the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT). He tipped his father Alfred C. Mindlin, a certified public accountant. Father and son then illegally traded in four different securities underlying the XRT with knowledge of massive, market-moving trades in these securities that Goldman would later execute. The case marks the SECâs first insider trading enforcement action involving ETFs. âWith his fatherâs helping hand, Spencer Mindlin exploited his inside knowledge of Goldmanâs complex hedging strategies to line his own pockets,â said George S. Canellos, Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. Sanjay Wadhwa, Associate Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office and Deputy Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, added, âWe are aggressively working to identify and prosecute illegal insider trading across multiple markets and derivatives products regardless of the complexity of the trading pattern that we have to unravel in our investigations.â According to the SEC's order instituting proceedings against the Mindlins, the insider trading occurred in December 2007 and March 2008. Goldman was the largest institutional holder of the XRT in order to allow its customers to short the XRT. To hedge its long position in the XRT, Goldman shorted the individual securities underlying the XRT. The SECâs Division of Enforcement alleges that by virtue of his position on Goldmanâs ETF desk, Spencer Mindlin knew Goldmanâs current nonpublic position in the XRT and Goldmanâs nonpublic plans to trade large amounts of securities underlying the XRT in order to hedge its position in the XRT. Spencer and Alfred Mindlin began purchasing and selling the four individual securities underlying the XRT within months after Spencer Mindlin joined Goldmanâs ETF desk. They placed almost all of their trades in a brokerage account in the name of another family member. Spencer Mindlin failed to disclose his and his fatherâs trading to Goldman. According to the SECâs order, Spencer Mindlin learned on multiple occasions about Goldmanâs trading intentions through e-mail communications he received shortly before he and his father placed their trades. In one instance when Alfred Mindlin phoned TD Ameritrade to upgrade the family memberâs account to allow for the trading of options, he received a call on another line from Spencer Mindlin while on hold with the TD Ameritrade representative. Because the TD Ameritrade call was recorded, Spencer and Alfred Mindlinâs conversation discussing a trade was captured on tape. In later instances, Spencer Mindlin impersonated his father on at least four calls to TD Ameritrade. On one call, he instructed the firm not to execute a trade too early in the day because this would âchew into my profit â my profit on this trade.â The Mindlins obtained at least $57,000 in illicit profits through their insider trading. The SECâs Division of Enforcement alleges that by engaging in the misconduct described in the SECâs order, the Mindlins willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The proceedings will determine what relief, if any, is in the public interest against the Mindlins, including disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and other remedial relief. The SECâs investigation was conducted by Sandeep M. Satwalekar and Maureen F. Lewis of the SECâs Market Abuse Unit in New York and by Robert Murphy and Stephen Johnson of the New York Regional Office. Alexander M. Vasilescu will lead the SECâs litigation efforts.

664,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged RBC Capital Markets LLC for misconduct in the sale of unsuitable investments to five Wisconsin school districts and its inadequate disclosures regarding the risks associated with those investments. According to the SECâs order instituting administrative proceedings, RBC Capital marketed and sold to trusts created by the school districts $200 million of credit-linked notes that were tied to the performance of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The school districts contributed $37.3 million of district funds to the investments with the remainder of the investment coming from funds borrowed by the trusts. The sales took place despite significant concerns within RBC Capital about the suitability of the product for municipalities like the school districts. Additionally, RBC Capitalâs marketing materials failed to adequately explain the risks associated with the investments. RBC Capital agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying a total of $30.4 million that will be distributed in varying amounts to the school districts through a Fair Fund. Last month, the SEC separately charged St. Louis-based brokerage firm Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. and a former senior executive with fraudulent misconduct in connection with the same sale of the CDO investments to the school districts. âRBC failed Securities 101 when it sold complex derivatives that were unsuitable to five school districts without fully informing them of the risks,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. Kenneth R. Lench, Chief of the SEC Division of Enforcementâs Structured and New Products Unit, added, âRBC Capital did not provide these school districts with full and accurate information regarding the risks of these complex structured products. We are pleased that todayâs settlement will result in a significant recovery by the school districts.â According to the SECâs order, the five school districts are Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, Kimberly Area School District, School District of Waukesha, West Allis-West Milwaukee School District, and School District of Whitefish Bay. The board members and business managers for the school districts had no prior experience investing in CDOs or instruments tied to CDOs. Compared to the typical buyers of instruments tied to CDOs, the school districts were not sophisticated investors. The SECâs order finds that the school districts lacked sufficient knowledge and sophistication to appreciate the nature of such investments. RBC Capital consented to the entry of the SECâs order without admitting or denying any of its findings. The order censured RBC Capital and directed that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which among other things prohibit obtaining money by means of an untrue statement of material fact and engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. RBC Capital agreed to pay disgorgement of $6.6 million, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a penalty of $22 million. The SECâs investigation was conducted jointly by the Enforcement Divisionâs Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit led by Elaine Greenberg and Mark R. Zehner and Structured and New Products Unit led by Kenneth Lench and Reid Muoio. The investigative attorneys were Kevin Guerrero, Keshia W. Ellis and Ivonia K. Slade in Washington D.C. and Jeffrey A.

Federspiel, and its chairman and former chief executive, Alfred R. Berkeley III, a former president and vice chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Market, each agreed to pay $100,000. In settling the matter, Federspiel and Berkeley did not admit to or deny the SECâ??s findings. based Pipeline was launched in 2004 as an SEC-registered alternative trading system, a privately operated platform to trade securities outside of traditional exchanges. Alternative trading systems that display little or no information about customer orders are known as â??dark pools.â? Institutional investors use these venues to hide their trading intentions from others and avoid moving the market with large orders to buy or sell stock. According to the SECâ??s order, Pipeline described its trading platform as a â??crossing networkâ? that matched customer orders with those from other customers, providing â??natural liquidity.â? Pipelineâ??s claims were false and misleading because its parent company owned a trading entity that filled the vast majority of customer orders on Pipelineâ??s system, the SEC found. It said the affiliate, most recently known as Milstream Strategy Group LLC, sought to predict the trading intentions of Pipelineâ??s customers and trade elsewhere in the same direction as customers before filling their orders on Pipelineâ??s platform. The SECâ??s order found that Pipeline generally did not provide the â??natural liquidityâ? it advertised. Pipeline took certain steps to address the conflict of interest it created, including by paying the affiliateâ??s traders using a formula that rewarded them in part for giving favorable prices to Pipelineâ??s customers. The SECâ??s order found that Pipeline failed to disclose the compensation formula or Milstreamâ??s activities to its customers or in its filings to the SEC. â??However orders are placed and executed, be it on an exchange floor or in an automated venue, whether dark or displayed, one principle remains fundamental â?? investors are entitled to accurate information as to how their trades are executed. Pipeline and its senior executives are being held to account because they misled their customers about how Pipelineâ??s dark pool really worked,â? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâ??s Enforcement Division. George S. Canellos, Director of the SECâ??s New York Regional Office, added, â??Todayâ??s action underscores the importance of full disclosure by those who operate alternative trading systems about their operations and the execution services they provide.â? The SECâ??s order also found that, although Pipeline represented that all users were treated the same, it provided Milstream with certain advantages over other users, including special access to certain information about the operations of the dark pool and to data connections that made it easier for Milstream to track history and activity in the dark pool. The SECâ??s order also found that Pipeline failed adequately to protect customersâ?? confidential trading information, allowing access to it by the research director at Pipelineâ??s parent company, who acted as the manager for the affiliated trading entity from 2004 to 2006. The order does not allege that the research director sought to take advantage of the customer information. The SECâ??s order found that Pipeline violated: The SECâ??s order found that Federspiel and Berkeley caused Pipeline to violate Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rules 301(b)(2) and 301(b)(10) of Regulation ATS. Without admitting or denying the findings, Pipeline, Federspiel, and Berkeley consented to the SECâ??s order, which requires Pipeline to pay a $1 million penalty and Federspiel and Berkeley each to pay $100,000. It also requires Pipeline, Federspiel, and Berkeley to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation ATS. Gerald Gross, Daniel Walfish, Stephen Larson, and Alexander Janghorbani of the SECâ??s New York Regional Office conducted the investigation. Mr. Walfish is a member of the SECâ??s Market Abuse Unit.

668,"ÂÂ The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former McKinsey & Co. global head Rajat K. Gupta with insider trading for illegally tipping convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam while serving on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble (P&G). The SEC also filed new insider trading charges against Rajaratnam after first charging him with insider trading in October 2009. According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta illegally tipped Rajaratnam with insider information about the quarterly earnings of both Goldman Sachs and P&G as well as an impending $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway at the height of the financial crisis. Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Management who was recently convicted of multiple counts of insider trading in other securities stemming from unrelated insider trading schemes, allegedly caused various Galleon funds to trade based on Guptaâs inside information, generating illicit profits or loss avoidance of more than $23 million. âGupta was honored with the highest trust of leading public companies, and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets to the disadvantage of investors, shareholders, and fellow directors,â said Robert S. Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âDirectors who exploit board room confidences for private gain can be certain they will ultimately be held responsible for their illegal actions.â The SECâs complaint alleges that Gupta provided his friend and business associate Rajaratnam with confidential information learned during board calls and in other communications and meetings relating to his official duties as a director of Goldman and P&G. Rajaratnam used the inside information to trade on behalf of certain Galleon funds, or shared the information with others at his firm who caused other Galleon funds to trade on it ahead of public announcements by the firms. During this period, Gupta had a variety of business dealings with Rajaratnam and stood to benefit from his relationship with him. According to the SECâs complaint, Gupta while serving as a Goldman board member tipped Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathawayâs $5 billion investment in Goldman and Goldmanâs upcoming public equity offering before that information was publicly announced on Sept. 23, 2008. Based on this inside information, Rajaratnam arranged for Galleon funds to purchase more than 215,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam later informed another participant in the scheme that he received the tip on which he traded only minutes before market close. Rajaratnam caused the Galleon funds to liquidate their Goldman holdings the following day after the information became public, making illicit profits of more than $800,000. of-the-money Goldman call options and 350,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam liquidated these positions on or around June 17 â the date when Goldman announced its quarterly earnings â generating illicit profits of more than $18.5 million for the Galleon funds. The SECâs complaint further alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam with confidential information that Gupta learned during an Oct. 23, 2008, board posting call about Goldmanâs impending negative financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Mere seconds after the board call ended, Gupta tipped Rajaratnam, who then arranged for certain Galleon funds to begin selling their Goldman holdings shortly after the financial markets opened the following day until the funds finished selling off their holdings, which had consisted of more than 150,000 shares. In discussing trading and market information that day with another participant in the insider trading scheme, Rajaratnam explained that while Wall Street expected Goldman to earn $2.50 per share, he heard the prior day from a Goldman board member that the company was actually going to lose $2 per share. As a result of Rajaratnamâs trades based on inside information provided by Gupta, the Galleon funds avoided losses of more than $3.6 million. The SECâs complaint additionally alleges that Gupta illegally disclosed to Rajaratnam inside information about P&Gâs financial results for the quarter ending December 2008. Gupta participated in a telephonic meeting of P&Gâs Audit Committee at 9 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2009, to discuss the planned release of P&Gâs quarterly earnings the next day. A draft of the earnings release, which had been mailed to Gupta and the other committee members two days before the meeting, indicated that P&Gâs expected organic sales would be less than previously publicly predicted. Gupta called Rajaratnam in the early afternoon on January 29, and Rajaratnam shortly afterwards informed another participant in the insider trading scheme that he had learned from a contact on P&Gâs board that the companyâs organic sales growth would be lower than expected. Galleon funds then sold short approximately 180,000 P&G shares, making illicit profits of more than $570,000. 5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge on a joint and several basis their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Gupta from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company, and to permanently enjoin him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.

The SECâs complaint further alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam with confidential information that Gupta learned during an Oct. 23, 2008, board posting call about Goldmanâs impending negative financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Mere seconds after the board call ended, Gupta tipped Rajaratnam, who then arranged for certain Galleon funds to begin selling their Goldman holdings shortly after the financial markets opened the following day until the funds finished selling off their holdings, which had consisted of more than 150,000 shares. In discussing trading and market information that day with another participant in the insider trading scheme, Rajaratnam explained that while Wall Street expected Goldman to earn $2.50 per share, he heard the prior day from a Goldman board member that the company was actually going to lose $2 per share. As a result of Rajaratnamâs trades based on inside information provided by Gupta, the Galleon funds avoided losses of more than $3.6 million. The SECâs complaint additionally alleges that Gupta illegally disclosed to Rajaratnam inside information about P&Gâs financial results for the quarter ending December 2008. Gupta participated in a telephonic meeting of P&Gâs Audit Committee at 9 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2009, to discuss the planned release of P&Gâs quarterly earnings the next day. A draft of the earnings release, which had been mailed to Gupta and the other committee members two days before the meeting, indicated that P&Gâs expected organic sales would be less than previously publicly predicted. Gupta called Rajaratnam in the early afternoon on January 29, and Rajaratnam shortly afterwards informed another participant in the insider trading scheme that he had learned from a contact on P&Gâs board that the companyâs organic sales growth would be lower than expected. Galleon funds then sold short approximately 180,000 P&G shares, making illicit profits of more than $570,000. 5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge on a joint and several basis their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Gupta from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company, and to permanently enjoin him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.

673,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today ordered the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to hire an independent consultant and undertake other remedial measures to improve its policies, procedures, and training for producing documents during SEC inspections. According to the SECs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, certain documents requested by the SECs Chicago Regional Office during an inspection were altered just hours before FINRAs Kansas City District Office provided them. The law requires FINRA to produce the documents the SEC seeks in its examinations in complete and accurate form, said Gerald Hodgkins, Associate Director of the SECs Division of Enforcement. Although FINRA has previously taken steps to improve compliance, those enhancements did not go far enough to prevent the document production failure that occurred in its Kansas City District Office. This order will help ensure that FINRA effectively addresses the weaknesses in its training as well as its policies and procedures. The SECs order finds that on Aug. 7, 2008, the Director of FINRAs Kansas City District Office caused the alteration of three records of staff meeting minutes just hours before producing them to the SEC inspection staff, making the documents inaccurate and incomplete. According to the SECs order, the production of the altered documents by the Kansas City District Office was the third instance during an eight-year period in which an employee of FINRA or its predecessor (National Association of Securities Dealers) provided altered or misleading documents to the SEC. FINRA has consented to engage an independent consultant within 30 days that will: Without admitting or denying the findings, FINRA consented to the SECs order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 17a-1, and to comply with the undertakings described above.

674,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) with violating securities laws in a fee arrangement that repeatedly charged a fund and its investors for advisory services they werenât actually receiving from a third party. The SECâs Enforcement Division Asset Management Unit has been focused on fee arrangements with registered funds. The SECâs investigation found that MSIM â the primary investment adviser to The Malaysia Fund â represented to investors and the fundâs board of directors that it contracted a Malaysian-based sub-adviser to provide advice, research and assistance to MSIM for the benefit of the fund, which invests in equity securities of Malaysian companies. The sub-adviser did not provide these purported advisory services, yet the fundâs board annually renewed the contract based on MSIMâs representations for more than a decade at a total cost of $1.845 million to investors. MSIM agreed to pay more than $3.3 million to settle the SECâs charges. The SECâs Asset Management Unit has an initiative inquiring into the investment advisory contract renewal process and fee arrangements in the fund industry. âWe want to take the advisory fee setting process out of the shadows by scrutinizing the role of investment advisers and fund board members in vetting fee arrangements with registered funds,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. According to the SECâs order instituting the settled administrative proceedings, The Malaysia Fundâs board of directors evaluated and approved the sub-adviser fees each year from 1996 to 2007 based on MSIMâs representations during whatâs known as the â15(c) process.â Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act requires an investment adviser to provide a fundâs board with information that is reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of any contract whereby a person undertakes regularly to serve as an investment adviser of a registered investment company. âMSIM failed in its duty to provide the fundâs board members with the information they needed to fulfill their significant responsibility of reviewing and approving the sub-adviserâs contract,â said Bruce Karpati, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Asset Management Unit. âMSIMâs failure undermined the integrity of the boardâs oversight process.â According to the SECâs order, MSIM arranged The Malaysia Fundâs sub-advisory agreement with a subsidiary of AM Bank Group, one of the largest banking groups in Malaysia. Despite the research and advisory agreement stating that the AM Bank Group subsidiary (AMMB) would provide MSIM with âinvestment advice, research and assistance, as [MSIM] shall from time to time reasonably request,â the SEC found that AMMB merely provided two monthly reports based on publicly available information that MSIM neither requested nor used in its management of the fund. Furthermore, MSIMâs oversight and involvement with AMMB during the relevant time period were wholly inadequate. MSIM had no written procedures specifically governing its oversight of sub-advisers, and did not have a procedure in place for reviewing work done by AMMB. According to the SECâs order, MSIM also was responsible for preparing and filing the fundâs annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders. The fundâs filings stated that for an advisory fee, AMMB provided MSIM with âinvestment advice, research and assistance.â Since AMMB was not providing any advisory services, MSIM prepared and filed false information in the annual and semi-annual reports. âNot only did MSIMâs internal controls fail in allowing this purported services arrangement to go on, but the firm repeatedly issued reports to investors that inaccurately represented those services,â said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SECâs Miami Regional Office. âMSIM clearly lost sight of this sub-adviser.â According to the SECâs order, the fundâs sub-adviser contract with AMMB was terminated in early 2008 after the SECâs examination staff inquired into the fundâs relationship with the sub-adviser. The SECâs order finds that MSIM willfully violated Sections 15(c) and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act and Sections 206(2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings, MSIM agreed to a censure and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of those provisions. MSIM agreed to repay the fund $1.845 million for the sub-adviserâs fees and pay a $1.5 million penalty. MSIM also agreed to implement policies and procedures specifically governing the Section 15(c) process and its oversight of service providers. The SECâs case was handled by Chad Alan Earnst, Christine Lynch, and Jessica Weiner, members of the Asset Management Unit in the Miami Regional Office, and Tonya Tullis, staff accountant.

677,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged seven former Siemens executives with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for their involvement in the company's decade-long bribery scheme to retain a $1 billion government contract to produce national identity cards for Argentine citizens. Siemens was previously charged with FCPA violations and paid $1.6 billion to resolve the charges with the SEC, U.S. Department of Justice, and Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich. The SEC alleges that the executives who perpetuated the scheme worked at Siemens and its regional company Siemens Argentina. One of the executives had left Siemens and acted as a payment intermediary in the scheme. Siemens paid more than $100 million in bribes to such high-ranking officials as two former Argentine presidents and former cabinet members. The executives falsified documents including invoices and sham consulting contracts, and participated in meetings in the United States to negotiate the terms of bribe payments. They used U.S. bank accounts to pay some of the bribes. ""Business should flow to the company with the best product and the best price, not the best bribe,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Corruption erodes public trust and the transparency of our commercial markets, and undermines corporate governance."" In a parallel criminal action, the Department of Justice announced charges against former executives and agents of Siemens. They are charged with conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the wire fraud statute, money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud. According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the scheme lasted from approximately 1996 to early 2007. Initially, the bribes were paid to secure a $1 billion contract to produce national identity cards known as Documentos Nacionales de Identidad (DNI) for every Argentine citizen. After a change in Argentine political administrations resulted in the DNI contract being suspended and then canceled, Siemens paid additional bribes in a failed effort to revive the DNI contract. When the company later instituted an arbitration proceeding to recover its costs and expected profits from the canceled contract, Siemens paid additional bribes to suppress evidence that the contract originally had been obtained through corruption. The former Siemens and Siemens Argentina executives charged by the SEC each had a role in authorizing, negotiating, facilitating, or concealing bribe payments in connection with the DNI contract: According to the SEC's complaint, approximately $31.3 million of the $100 million in bribes paid were made after March 12, 2001, when Siemens became a U.S. issuer subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of the bribe payments it made, Siemens received an arbitration award in 2007 against the government of Argentina of more than $217 million plus interest for the DNI contract. In August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the U.S. and Germany, Siemens waived the arbitration award. The SEC complaint alleges that Bock, Regendantz, Sergi, Sharef, Signer, Steffen, and Truppel each violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and aided and abetted Siemens' violations of Section 30A. The complaint also alleges that they violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder by authorizing or directing others to falsify documents in furtherance of the bribery scheme. Regendantz violated Rule 13b2-2 by signing false internal certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX). They each also aided and abetted Siemens' violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) by substantially assisting in the company's failure to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery of government officials in Argentina, and by substantially assisting in the improper recording of the bribe payments in Siemens' accounting books and records. Regendantz settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from committing future violations. He paid a Â30,000 administrative fine ordered by the Munich prosecutor (equivalent to $40,000 in U.S. dollars). The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tracy L.

678,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Daniel Ruettiger and 12 other participants in a scheme to deceive investors into buying stock in his sports drink company. Ruettiger is widely known for having inspired the 1993 motion picture ""Rudy."" According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Ruettiger founded Rudy Nutrition to compete with Gatorade in the sports drink market. Rudy Nutrition produced and sold modest amounts of a sports drink called âRudyâ with the tagline âDream Big! Never Quit!â However, the company primarily served as a vehicle for a pump-and-dump scheme that occurred in 2008 and generated more than $11 million in illicit profits. The SEC alleges that investors were provided false and misleading statements about the company in press releases, SEC filings, and promotional materials. For example, a promotional mailer to potential investors falsely claimed that in âa major southwest test, Rudy outsold Gatorade 2 to 1!â A promotional e-mail falsely boasted that in âseveral blind taste tests, Rudy outperformed Gatorade and Powerade by 2:1.â Meanwhile, the schemeâs promoters engaged in manipulative trading to artificially inflate the price of Rudy Nutrition stock while selling unregistered shares to investors. The SEC suspended trading and later revoked registration of the stock in late 2008. Rudy Nutrition is no longer in business. âInvestors were lured into the scheme by Mr. Ruettiger's well-known, feel-good story but found themselves in a situation that did not have a happy ending,â said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe tall tales in this elaborate scheme included phony taste tests and other false information that was used to convince investors they were investing in something special.â According to the SECâs complaint, Ruettiger was the principal founder and namesake of a company called Rudy Beverage Inc. that he and a college friend ran out of South Bend, Ind. until October 2007, when Rocky Brandonisio became the companyâs president and day-to-day business manager. He moved the companyâs operations to Las Vegas, where he and Ruettiger live. Ruettiger remained CEO. During this time, the company struggled financially with few customers, few assets, and no profits. The SEC alleges that Ruettiger and Brandonisio brought in an experienced penny stock promoter named Stephen DeCesare to orchestrate a public distribution of company stock in late 2007. Ruettiger knew DeCesare from previous business dealings, and they were neighbors in Las Vegas. Ruettiger and Brandonisio gave DeCesare sufficient control to turn Rudy Beverage into a publicly traded company. DeCesare became the primary organizer of the resulting pump-and-dump scheme According to the SECâs complaint, DeCesare identified a shell corporation quoted on the Pink Sheets for use in whatâs known as a reverse merger, which occurs when a private company acquires a public company (typically a shell company) in order to become publicly-traded. DeCesare tasked a business consultant named Kevin Quinn with executing the merger and working with the companyâs transfer agent to issue purportedly unrestricted stock. On Feb. 11, 2008, they acquired the shell company in a reverse merger and changed its name to âRudy Nutrition.â Ruettiger authorized his signature to be placed electronically on an SEC filing four days later, and Rudy Nutrition began to be quoted on the Pink Sheets on Feb. 21, 2008, under the ticker symbol RUNU. DeCesare and Quinn, who is a disbarred California lawyer, arranged for three billion RUNU shares to be issued to nominee entities, which sold almost one billion shares to unsuspecting investors in the public market during the scheme. The SEC alleges that DeCesare then organized the efforts to pump RUNU stock by partnering with other penny stock promoters to inflate the price and volume artificially through fraudulent touting and manipulative trading. The schemeâs participants made a series of false or misleading statements about RUNU to the public in mailers sent to millions of U.S. investors, messages posted in Internet chat rooms dedicated to penny stocks, and videos placed on the Internet for public viewing. False and misleading statements about the company also were made in press releases and filings with the SEC. These disingenuous promotional efforts had the predictable effect of attracting buyers to RUNU stock. In less than a month, RUNU went from trading 720 shares to more than 3 million shares, and within two weeks the price of RUNU stock climbed from 25 cents to $1.05 per share. After March 12, 2008, RUNU stock began a roller coaster ride as the schemeâs participants sold millions of RUNU shares to the market amid their simultaneous efforts to pump the stock. According to the SECâs complaint, the scheme eventually ended when the SEC issued a trading suspension against RUNU on Sept. 12, 2008 for delinquent periodic filings. Only days before the trading suspension, arrangements were being made to issue another two billion shares that scheme participants planned to dump on the market at the end of September 2008. But they were unable to do so because of the SECâs trading suspension. The SEC revoked the registration of Rudy Nutrition securities on Nov. 14, 2008. Ruettiger and 10 of the schemeâs other participants have agreed to settle the SECâs charges without admitting or denying the allegations. The settlements, which are subject to court approval, impose penny stock bars and officer-and-director bars as appropriate. Ruettiger agreed to pay $382,866 in settling the charges, and other participants consented to final judgments also ordering disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. In addition to Ruettiger, Brandonisio, DeCesare, and Quinn, the SECâs complaint charges the following participants in the scheme: Charges against Dynkowski and Smanjak are not settled, and litigation against them continues. The SECâs investigation was led by Antony R. Petrilla and Brian O. Quinn, and litigation against the remaining defendants will be led by Kyle M. DeYoung and Paul W. Kisslinger.

679,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged six former top executives of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) with securities fraud, alleging they knew and approved of misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal holdings of higher-risk mortgage loans, including subprime loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Commission in which each company agreed to accept responsibility for its conduct and not dispute, contest, or contradict the contents of an agreed-upon Statement of Facts without admitting nor denying liability. Each also agreed to cooperate with the Commission's litigation against the former executives. In entering into these Agreements, the Commission considered the unique circumstances presented by the companies' current status, including the financial support provided to the companies by the U.S. Treasury, the role of the Federal Housing Finance Agency as conservator of each company, and the costs that may be imposed on U.S. taxpayers. Three former Fannie Mae executives â former Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Mudd, former Chief Risk Officer Enrico Dallavecchia, and former Executive Vice President of Fannie Mae's Single Family Mortgage business, Thomas A. Lund â were named in the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The SEC also charged three former Freddie Mac executives â former Chairman of the Board and CEO Richard F. Syron, former Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer Patricia L. Cook, and former Executive Vice President for the Single Family Guarantee business Donald J. Bisenius â in a separate complaint filed in the same court. ""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives told the world that their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. ""These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the market about the amount of risk on the company's books. All individuals, regardless of their rank or position, will be held accountable for perpetuating half-truths or misrepresentations about matters materially important to the interest of our country's investors."" The SEC is seeking financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, permanent injunctive relief and officer and director bars against Mudd, Dallavecchia, Lund, Syron, Cook, and Bisenius. Both lawsuits allege that the former executives caused the federal mortgage firms to materially misstate their holdings of subprime mortgage loans in periodic and other filings with the Commission, public statements, investor calls, and media interviews. The suit involving the Fannie Mae executives also includes similar allegations regarding Alt-A mortgage loans. The suit against the former Fannie Mae executives alleges they made misleading statements â or aided and abetted others â between December 2006 and August 2008. The former Freddie Mac executives are alleged to have made misleading statements â or aided and abetted others - between March 2007 and August 2008. The SEC's complaint against the former Fannie Mae executives alleges that, when Fannie Mae began reporting its exposure to subprime loans in 2007, it broadly described the loans as those ""made to borrowers with weaker credit histories,"" and then reported â with the knowledge, support, and approval of Mudd, Dallavecchia, and Lund â less than one-tenth of its loans that met that description. Fannie Mae reported that its 2006 year-end Single Family exposure to subprime loans was just 0.2 percent, or approximately $4.8 billion, of its Single Family loan portfolio. Investors were not told that in calculating the Company's reported exposure to subprime loans, Fannie Mae did not include loan products specifically targeted by Fannie Mae towards borrowers with weaker credit histories, including more than $43 billion of Expanded Approval, or ""EA"" loans. Fannie Mae's executives also knew and approved of the decision to underreport Fannie Mae's Alt-A loan exposure, the SEC alleged. Fannie Mae disclosed that its March 31, 2007 exposure to Alt-A loans was 11 percent of its portfolio of Single Family loans. In reality, Fannie Mae's Alt-A exposure at that time was approximately 18 percent of its Single Family loan holdings. The misleading disclosures were made as Fannie Mae's executives were seeking to increase the Company's market share through increased purchases of subprime and Alt-A loans, and gave false comfort to investors about the extent of Fannie Mae's exposure to high-risk loans, the SEC alleged. In the complaint against the former Freddie Mac executives, the SEC alleged that they and Freddie Mac led investors to believe that the firm used a broad definition of subprime loans and was disclosing all of its Single-Family subprime loan exposure. Syron and Cook reinforced the misleading perception when they each publicly proclaimed that the Single Family business had ""basically no subprime exposure."" Unbeknown to investors, as of December 31, 2006, Freddie Mac's Single Family business was exposed to approximately $141 billion of loans internally referred to as ""subprime"" or ""subprime like,"" accounting for 10 percent of the portfolio, and grew to approximately $244 billion, or 14 percent of the portfolio, as of June 30, 2008. The SEC's complaint alleges that Mudd violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5(b) and 13(a)14(a) thereunder, and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act""); and that Mudd aided and abetted Fannie Mae's violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC complaint also alleges that Dallavecchia violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and aided and abetted Fannie Mae's violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Finally, the SEC complaint alleges that Lund aided and abetted Fannie Mae's violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC's complaint alleges that Syron and Cook violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder and Securities Act Section 17(a)(2); that Syron violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; and that Syron, Cook and Bisenius aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Benach, and Associate Chief Accountant, Peter Rosario, under the supervision of Assistant Director Charles E. Cain, and Associate Director Stephen L. Cohen.

682,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the largest telecommunications provider in Hungary and three of its former top executives with bribing government and political party officials in Macedonia and Montenegro to win business and shut out competition in the telecommunications industry. The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc. orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in 2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain other regulatory benefits. Magyar Telekom's subsidiaries in Macedonia made illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus consulting and marketing contracts. The same executives orchestrated a second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom's acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there. Magyar Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel money to government officials in Montenegro. Magyar Telekom's parent company Deutsche Telekom AG also is charged with books and records and internal controls violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Magyar Telekom agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $31.2 million in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest. Magyar Telekom also agreed to pay a $59.6 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice. Deutsche Telekom settled the SEC's charges, and as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice agreed to pay a penalty of $4.36 million. ""Magyar Telekom's senior executives used sham contracts to funnel millions of dollars in corrupt payments to foreign officials who could help them keep competitors out and win business,"" said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA Unit. ""They purposely structured the sham contracts to circumvent internal review, and when questions were eventually raised about their use of 'consulting' contracts, they reconfigured them as 'marketing' contracts to avoid scrutiny and prolong their scheme."" The three former top executives at Magyar Telekom charged by the SEC for orchestrating the bribery schemes are: Elek Straub, former Chairman and CEO. Andras Balogh, former Director of Central Strategic Organization. Tamas Morvai, former Director of Business Development and Acquisitions. According to the SEC's complaints filed in the Southern District of New York, in the wake of legislation intended to liberalize the Macedonian telecommunications market, Magyar Telekom entered into a secret agreement entitled the ""Protocol of Cooperation"" with senior Macedonian government officials to delay or preclude the issuance of a license to a new competitor and mitigate other adverse effects of the new law. To win their support, Magyar Telekom paid Â4.875 million to a third-party intermediary under a series of sham contracts with the intention that the intermediary would forward money to the government officials. Magyar Telekom also promised a Macedonian political party the opportunity to designate the beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for the party's support. The SEC further alleges that in Montenegro, Magyar Telekom used intermediaries to pay bribes to government officials in return for their support of Magyar Telekom's acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company on terms favorable to Magyar Telekom. At least two Montenegrin government officials involved in the acquisition received payments made through the bogus contracts. A family member of a top Montenegrin government official also received payments. The SEC's complaint against Straub, Balogh, and Morvai alleges that they violated or aided and abetted violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA; knowingly circumvented internal controls and falsified books and records; and made false statements to the company's auditor. The SEC seeks disgorgement and penalties and the imposition of permanent injunctions. Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC's case was investigated by Adam Eisner under the supervision of Charles Cain, Deputy Chief of the FCPA Unit. Robert Dodge will lead the SEC's litigation efforts.

683,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Texas-based financial services firm Life Partners Holdings Inc. and three of its senior executives for their involvement in a fraudulent disclosure and accounting scheme involving life settlements.    The SEC alleges that Life Partners chairman and CEO Brian Pardo, president and general counsel Scott Peden, and chief financial officer David Martin misled shareholders by failing to disclose a significant risk to Life Partners? business: the company was systematically and materially underestimating the life expectancy estimates it used to price transactions. Life expectancy estimates are a critical factor impacting the company?s revenues and profit margins as well as the company?s ability to generate profits for its shareholders.    The SEC alleges that Life Partners and the three executives were involved in disclosure violations and improper accounting that Life Partners used to overvalue assets held on the company?s books and create the appearance of a steady stream of earnings from brokering life settlement transactions. The SEC further charged Pardo and Peden with insider trading in their shares of Life Partners stock while in possession of material, non-public information indicating that the company had systematically and materially underestimated life expectancy estimates.    ?Life Partners duped its shareholders by employing an unqualified medical doctor to assign baseless life expectancy estimates to the underlying insurance policies,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ?This deception misled shareholders into thinking that the company's revenue model was sustainable when in fact it was illusory.?    David Woodcock, Director of the SEC?s Fort Worth Regional Office, added, ?The senior-most executives at Life Partners concealed significant risks to the business, manipulated financial statements with improper accounting, and knowingly profited from their misconduct by executing insider trades based on information that was not available to the public.?    Life Partners is a Nasdaq-traded company that generates virtually all of its revenues from brokering life settlements. Life settlements involve the purchase and sale of fractional interests of life insurance policies in the secondary market. In life settlement transactions, life insurance policy owners sell their policies to investors in exchange for a lump-sum payment. The dollar amount offered by the investor takes into account the insured?s life expectancy and the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.    According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal district court in Waco, Texas, Life Partners misrepresented and failed to disclose in public filings with the SEC that the company?s systematic use of materially underestimated life expectancy estimates constituted a material risk to the company?s revenues. Beginning in 1999, the company used life expectancy estimates provided by Dr. Donald T. Cassidy, a Reno, Nev.-based doctor with no actuarial training or prior experience rendering life expectancy estimates. The SEC alleges that Life Partners and Pardo failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence on Cassidy?s qualification to act as a life expectancy underwriter and instructed the doctor to use a life expectancy methodology that was created by the company?s former underwriter, a part-owner of Life Partners. Pardo, Peden, and Martin were aware that the Cassidy-rendered life expectancy estimates were systematically and materially short.    The SEC alleges that Life Partners materially misstated net income from fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 by prematurely recognizing revenues and understating impairment expense related to its investments in life settlements. Life Partners improperly accelerated revenue recognition from the closing date to the date it obtained a non-binding agreement with the policy owner to sell a life settlement. Life Partners use of Cassidy?s life expectancy estimates as part of its impairment calculations caused the company to understate millions of dollars in impairment expense.    The SEC further alleges that during this time, Pardo and Peden sold approximately $11.5 million and $300,000 respectively of Life Partners stock at inflated prices while in possession of material non-public information about the company?s dependency on short life expectancy estimates to generate revenues.    In addition to the alleged violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by Life Partners, Pardo, Peden and Martin, the SEC?s complaint also seeks repayment to the company of stock sales profits and bonuses received by Pardo and Martin pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

684,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the holding company for one of Florida?s largest banks and its top executive with misleading investors about growing problems in one of its significant loan portfolios early in the financial crisis.    The SEC alleges that BankAtlantic Bancorp and its CEO and chairman Alan Levan made misleading statements in public filings and earnings calls in order to hide the deteriorating state of a large portion of the bank?s commercial residential real estate land acquisition and development portfolio in 2007. BankAtlantic and Levan then committed accounting fraud when they schemed to minimize BankAtlantic?s losses on their books by improperly recording loans they were trying to sell from this portfolio in late 2007.    ?BankAtlantic and Levan used accounting gimmicks to conceal from investors the losses in a critical loan portfolio,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""This is exactly the type of information that is important to investors, and corporate executives who fail to make that required disclosure will face severe consequences.""    According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, BankAtlantic and Levan knew that a large portion of the loan portfolio ? which consisted primarily of loans on large tracts of lands intended for development into single family housing and condominiums ? was deteriorating in early 2007 because many of the loans had required extensions due to borrowers? inability to meet their loan obligations. Some loans were kept current only by extending the loan terms or replenishing the interest reserves from an increase in the loan principal. Levan knew this negative information in part from participating in the bank?s Major Loan Committee that approved the extensions and principal increases. BankAtlantic and Levan also were aware that many of the loans had been internally downgraded to non-passing status, indicating the bank was deeply concerned about those loans.    ?BankAtlantic and Levan publicly minimized the risks in the bank?s commercial residential loan portfolio when in reality, they had significant concerns about the borrowers? ability to pay,? said Eric I. Bustillo, Miami Regional Office Director. ?Investors had a right to know this key information.?    The SEC alleges that despite this knowledge, BankAtlantic?s public filings in the first two quarters of 2007 made only generic warnings of what may occur in the future if Florida?s real estate downturn continued. BankAtlantic failed to disclose the downward trend already occurring in its own portfolio. The steady deterioration of this portfolio constituted a known trend that should have been disclosed in the Management?s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of BankAtlantic?s filings, which were signed by Levan. During earnings calls in the same time period, Levan made further misleading statements to investors about the portfolio. BankAtlantic finally acknowledged the problems in the third quarter of 2007 by announcing a large unexpected loss. The investing public did not expect a loss of that magnitude, and BankAtlantic?s share price immediately dropped 37 percent.    According to the SEC?s complaint, BankAtlantic and Levan attempted to sell some of the deteriorating loans after this announcement. However, they failed to account for them properly as being ?held for sale,? which is required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). BankAtlantic concealed the attempted sales from auditors and investors alike, because proper accounting would have required BankAtlantic to write them down and incur immediate additional losses. Instead, BankAtlantic schemed to understate its net loss by more than 10 percent in its 2007 annual report.    The SEC?s complaint seeks financial penalties and permanent injunctive relief against BankAtlantic and Levan to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.

685,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two multi-billion dollar hedge fund advisory firms as well as seven fund managers and analysts involved in a $78 million insider trading scheme based on nonpublic information about Dell?s quarterly earnings and other similar inside information about Nvidia Corporation. The charges stem from the SEC?s ongoing investigation into the trading activities of hedge funds. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the same seven individuals. The SEC alleges that a network of closely associated hedge fund traders at Stamford, Conn.-based Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Greenwich, Conn.-based Level Global Investors LP illegally obtained the material nonpublic information about Dell and Nvidia. Investment analyst Sandeep ?Sandy? Goyal of Princeton, N.J., obtained Dell quarterly earnings information and other performance data from an insider at Dell in advance of earnings announcements in 2008. Goyal tipped Diamondback analyst Jesse Tortora of Pembroke Pines, Fla., with the inside information, and Tortora in turn tipped several others, leading to insider trades on behalf of Diamondback and Level Global hedge funds. ?These are not low-level employees succumbing to temptation by seizing a chance opportunity. These are sophisticated players who built a corrupt network to systematically and methodically obtain and exploit illegal inside information again and again at the expense of law-abiding investors and the integrity of the markets,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the illicit gains in the Dell insider trades exceeded $62.3 million, and the illicit gains in the Nvidia insider trades exceeded $15.7 million. For his role in the scheme, Goyal was paid $175,000 in soft dollar payments that were deposited in a brokerage account of an individual affiliated with him. The SEC alleges that after obtaining the inside information from Goyal in advance of Dell?s first and second quarter earnings announcements in 2008, Tortora tipped his portfolio manager at Diamondback, Todd Newman of Needham, Mass. Newman traded on the information on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds he controlled. Tortora also tipped Spyridon ?Sam? Adondakis, an analyst at Level Global. Adondakis tipped his manager Anthony Chiasson, who then traded on the inside information on behalf of Level Global hedge funds. During this time period, both Adondakis and Chiasson lived in New York City. According to the SEC?s complaint, Tortora also tipped two others at firms other than Diamondback or Level Global with the Dell inside information: Jon Horvath of New York City and Danny Kuo of San Marino, Calif. Horvath caused insider trades at his firm that resulted in approximately $1.4 million of illicit gains. Kuo similarly caused the firm where he worked to execute profitable insider trades in Dell securities. The SEC further alleges that Kuo also obtained inside information about Nvidia Corporation?s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other financial metrics in advance of the company?s first quarter 2010 earnings announcement, which was made in May 2009. Kuo again caused his firm to trade on inside information. Kuo?s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $270,000 in ill-gotten gains. Kuo also tipped Tortora at Diamondback and Adondakis at Level Global with the nonpublic information about Nvidia. Tortora again tipped Newman, who made more insider trades on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds. The illegal trades in Dell and Nvidia securities resulted in $3.9 million in illicit gains for Diamondback. At Level Global, Adondakis tipped Chiasson who made the insider trades on behalf of those hedge funds. Chiasson?s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $72.6 million of illicit gains for the Level Global hedge funds. The SEC?s complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, additionally, charges Goyal, Tortora, Newman, Adondakis, Chiasson, Horvath and Kuo with aiding and abetting others? violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC?s complaint seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Joseph Sansone, Daniel Marcus and Stephen Larson ? members of the SEC?s Market Abuse Unit in New York ? and Matthew Watkins, Neil Hendelman, Diego Brucculeri and James D?Avino of the New York Regional Office.

686,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a trader in Latvia for conducting a widespread online account intrusion scheme in which he manipulated the prices of more than 100 NYSE and Nasdaq securities and caused more than $2 million in harm to customers of U.S. brokerage firms. The SEC also instituted related administrative proceedings today against four electronic trading firms and eight executives charged with enabling the trader?s scheme by allowing him anonymous and unfiltered access to the U.S. markets. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Igors Nagaicevs broke into online brokerage accounts of customers at large U.S. broker-dealers and drove stock prices up or down by making unauthorized purchases or sales in the hijacked accounts. This occurred on more than 150 occasions over the course of 14 months. Nagaicevs ? using the direct, anonymous market access provided to him by various unregistered firms ? traded those same securities at artificial prices and reaped more than $850,000 in illegal profits. ?Nagaicevs engaged in a brazen and systematic securities fraud, repeatedly raiding brokerage accounts and causing massive damages to innocent investors and their brokerage firms,? said Marc J. Fagel, Director of the SEC?s San Francisco Regional Office. According to the SEC?s orders instituting administrative proceedings against the four electronic trading firms, they allowed Nagaicevs to trade through their electronic platforms without first registering as brokers. Each of the trading firms provided him online access to trade directly in the U.S. markets through an account held in the firm?s name. These firms gave Nagaicevs a gateway to the U.S. securities markets while circumventing the protections of the federal securities laws, including requirements for brokers to maintain and follow adequate procedures to gather information about customers and their trading.  ?These firms provided unfettered access to trade in the U.S. securities markets on an essentially anonymous basis,? said Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC?s Market Abuse Unit. ?By failing to register as brokers, the firms and principals in this case exposed U.S. markets to real harm by evading crucial safeguards of the federal securities laws.?We will not allow firms like these to fly under the radar and become safe havens for market abuse.? The electronic trading firms and individuals named in the SEC?s administrative proceedings are:   Alchemy Ventures, Inc. of San Mateo, Calif.        Mark H. Rogers, the firm?s president, who lives in San Carlos, Calif.  Steven D. Hotovec, the firm?s vice president, who lives in Redwood City, Calif.    KM Capital Management, LLC of Philadelphia        Joshua A. Klein, the firm?s founder and co-owner, who lives in Philadelphia.  Yisroel M. Wachs, the firm?s co-owner, who lives in Philadelphia.    Zanshin Enterprises, LLC of Boise, Idaho        Frank K. McDonald, managing member of the firm, who lives in Boise.  Richard V. Rizzo, an associate of the firm, who lives in Oceanside, N.Y.    Mercury Capital of La Jolla, Calif.        Lisa R. Hyatt, the firm?s president, who lives in Escondido, Calif.  Douglas G. Frederick, an associate of the firm, who lives in Brighton, Mich.    Mercury Capital, Hyatt, and Rizzo each agreed to a settlement in which they consented to SEC orders finding that they committed or aided and abetted and caused broker registration violations. Hyatt and Rizzo each agreed to pay a $35,000 penalty. The SEC?s administrative action will determine whether the non-settling trading firms and principals violated the broker registration provision of the federal securities laws, or whether the non-settling principals aided and abetted and caused the firms? violations, and what sanctions, if any, are appropriate as a result. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Nagaicevs violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The SEC?s Market Abuse Unit, headed by chief Daniel M. Hawke and deputy chief Sanjay Wadhwa, conducted the investigation in this matter jointly with the agency?s San Francisco Regional Office under the leadership of Director Marc J. Fagel and Associate Director Michael S. Dicke. Jina L. Choi and Steven D. Buchholz ? members of the Market Abuse Unit in San Francisco ? together with Alice Jensen of the San Francisco Regional Office conducted the agency?s investigation, which is ongoing.

687,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four former veteran investment bankers and traders at Credit Suisse Group for engaging in a complex scheme to fraudulently overstate the prices of $3 billion in subprime bonds during the height of the subprime credit crisis. The SEC alleges that Credit Suisse?s former global head of structured credit trading Kareem Serageldin and former head of hedge trading David Higgs along with two mortgage bond traders deliberately ignored specific market information showing a sharp decline in the price of subprime bonds under the control of their group. They instead priced them in a way that allowed Credit Suisse to achieve fictional profits. Serageldin and Higgs periodically directed the traders to change the bond prices in order to hit daily and monthly profit targets, cover up losses in other trading books, and send a message to senior management about their group?s profitability. The SEC alleges that the mispricing scheme was driven in part by these investment bankers? desire for lavish year-end bonuses and, in the case of Serageldin, a promotion into the senior-most echelon of Credit Suisse?s investment banking unit. ?The stunning scale of the illegal mismarking in this case was surpassed only by the greed of the senior bankers behind the scheme,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?At precisely the moment investors and market participants were urgently seeking accurate information about financial institutions? exposure to the subprime market, the senior bankers falsely and selfishly inflated the value of more than $3 billion in asset-backed securities in order to protect their bonuses and, in one case, protect a highly coveted promotion.?  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Serageldin oversaw a significant portion of Credit Suisse?s structured products and mortgage-related businesses. The traders reported to Higgs and Serageldin. As the subprime credit crisis accelerated in late 2007 and 2008, Serageldin frequently communicated to Higgs the specific profit & loss (P&L) outcome he wanted. Higgs in turn directed the traders to mark the book in a manner that would achieve the desired P&L. However, under the relevant accounting principles and Credit Suisse policy, the group was required to record the prices of these bonds to accurately reflect their fair value. Proper pricing would have reflected that Credit Suisse was incurring significant losses as the subprime market collapsed. The SEC alleges that the scheme reached its peak at the end of 2007, when the group recorded falsely overstated year-end prices for the subprime bonds. Just days later in a recorded call, Serageldin and Higgs acknowledged that the year-end prices were too high and expressed a concern that risk personnel at Credit Suisse would ?spot? their mispricing. Despite acknowledging that the subprime bonds were mispriced, Serageldin approved his group?s year-end results without making any effort to correct the prices. When the mispricing was eventually detected in February 2008, Credit Suisse disclosed $2.65 billion in additional subprime-related losses related to the investment bankers? misconduct. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Serageldin, Higgs, and the traders Faisal Siddiqui and Salmaan Siddiqui violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 12b-20 and 13a-16 thereunder. Under the SEC?s Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to Agency Enforcement Decisions (Seaboard Report) and the Enforcement Division?s Cooperation Initiative, entities can benefit from acting swiftly to detect, report, and remediate misconduct and cooperate robustly with the SEC?s investigation. The SEC?s decision not to charge Credit Suisse was influenced by several factors, including the isolated nature of the wrongdoing and Credit Suisse?s immediate self-reporting to the SEC and other law enforcement agencies as well as prompt public disclosure of corrected financial results. Credit Suisse voluntarily terminated the four investment bankers and implemented enhanced internal controls to prevent a recurrence of the misconduct.

691,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged London-based medical device company Smith & Nephew PLC with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its U.S. and German subsidiaries bribed public doctors in Greece for more than a decade to win business.    Smith & Nephew PLC and its U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. agreed to pay more than $22 million in agreements with the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice. The charges stem from the SEC?s and DOJ?s ongoing proactive global investigation of bribery of publicly-employed physicians by medical device companies.    The SEC?s complaint against Smith & Nephew PLC alleges that its subsidiaries used a distributor to create a slush fund to make illicit payments to public doctors employed by government hospitals or agencies in Greece. On paper, it appeared as though Smith & Nephew?s subsidiaries were paying for marketing services, but no services were actually performed. The scheme basically created off-shore funds that were not subject to Greek taxes to pay bribes to public doctors to purchase Smith & Nephew products.    ?Smith & Nephew?s subsidiaries chose a path of corruption rather than fair and honest competition,? said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ?The SEC will continue to hold companies liable as we investigate the medical device industry for this type of illegal behavior.?    According to the SEC?s complaint against Smith & Nephew PLC filed in federal court in Washington D.C., U.S. subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. and German subsidiary Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics GmbH has sold orthopedic products in Greece since the 1970s through the Greek distributor. Greece has a national health care system in which most Greek hospitals are publicly-owned and operated, and doctors who work at those publicly-owned hospitals are government employees and ?foreign officials? as defined in the FCPA.    The SEC alleges that the misconduct began in 1997, when Smith & Nephew?s subsidiaries developed a scheme to make payments to three shell entities in the United Kingdom controlled by the distributor. Those funds were used by the distributor to pay bribes to the Greek doctors on behalf of the Smith & Nephew subsidiaries. Smith & Nephew failed to act on numerous red flags of bribery as employees at the company and its subsidiaries became aware of the payments. In one e-mail exchange between employees at the U.S. subsidiary and the distributor concerning whether to reduce the distributor?s commissions, the distributor stated, ?? In case it is not clear to you, please understand that I am paying cash incentives right after each surgery?? Smith & Nephew Inc. determined not to reduce the commissions.    Smith & Nephew PLC agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying more than $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Its subsidiary Smith & Nephew Inc. agreed to pay a $16.8 million fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. Smith & Nephew PLC consented without admitting or denying the SEC?s allegations, to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering it to retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of 18 months to review its FCPA compliance program.

Khan tipped Whitman with confidential details about Polycom Inc.'s fourth quarter 2005 earnings and Google Inc.'s second quarter 2007 earnings prior to the public announcements of those financial results by the companies.  Whitman Capital reaped nearly $1 million in ill-gotten gains by trading on Khan's illegal tips.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the inside information about Polycom and Google used by Whitman is the same information that the SEC has previously alleged Khan provided to many of her hedge fund contacts, including Rajaratnam as well as Robert Feinblatt and Jeffrey Yokuty at Trivium Capital. The SEC alleges that Khan illegally tipped Whitman in January 2006 with information about Polycom's quarterly financial results, and she noted that these details were nonpublic and acquired from a source at Polycom.  Whitman Capital accumulated 132,263 shares of Polycom stock in the next two weeks.  When the company announced its results on January 25, Whitman Capital liquidated its entire Polycom position for a profit of more than $360,000.  On at least one later occasion, in September 2008, Whitman asked Khan to contact her Polycom source to obtain inside information about the company's upcoming earnings so the two could ""short it.""  When Khan rebuffed Whitman citing a fear of getting caught, Whitman suggested that she use ""Skype"" to avoid detection.  Whitman later stated that he would stop speaking to Khan if she wasn't going to be a ""slimeball"" anymore. The SEC further alleges that Khan illegally tipped Whitman with inside information about Google's quarterly financial results shortly before the company's post market-close earnings announcement on July 19, 2007.  At Whitman's insistence, Khan identified her Google source as an employee of an investor relations firm used by Google.  Whitman Capital funds then purchased 2,761 Google put option contracts based on the tip from Khan.  On July 20, Whitman Capital closed the put option positions and generated ill-gotten profits of more than $620,000.  Afterwards, Whitman sent Khan a large floral arrangement to thank her for the tip. The SEC's complaint charges Whitman and Whitman Capital with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The SEC has charged 30 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds and by other traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders located throughout the country.  The insider trading occurred in the securities of more than 15 companies for illicit profits totaling more than $91 million. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Henderson and Joseph Sansone - members of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit in New York - and Diego Brucculeri and James D'Avino of the New York Regional Office.

693,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged John Kinnucan and his Portland, Oregon-based expert consulting firm Broadband Research Corporation with insider trading.  The charges stem from the SEC?s ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks.      The SEC alleges that Kinnucan and Broadband claimed to be in the business of providing clients with legitimate research about publicly-traded technology companies, but instead typically tipped clients with material nonpublic information that Kinnucan obtained from prohibited sources inside the companies.  Clients then traded on the inside information.  Portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge funds and investment advisers paid Kinnucan and Broadband significant consulting fees for the information they provided.  Kinnucan in turn compensated his sources with cash, meals, ski trips and other vacations, and even befriended some sources to gain access to confidential information.   In a parallel criminal case, Kinnucan has been arrested and charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two counts of securities fraud.   ?Obtaining important and unreported financial results from company insiders and selling that information to hedge funds is not legitimate expert networking services ? it?s old-fashioned insider trading,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. The SEC has charged 22 defendants in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms.  The insider trading has occurred in the securities of 12 technology companies ? including Apple, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, Marvell Technology, and Western Digital ? for illicit gains totaling nearly $110 million. Related SEC insider trading cases stemming from the Galleon investigation involved illicit gains in excess of $91 million.  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Kinnucan?s misconduct occurred from at least 2009 to 2010, a period during which he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenues for Broadband.  Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from well-placed employees at a variety of publicly-traded technology companies. The SEC?s complaint specifically alleges that in July 2010, Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from a source at F5 Networks Inc., a Seattle-based provider of networking technology.  On the morning of July 2, Kinnucan learned that F5 had generated better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter of its 2010 fiscal year, with the public announcement scheduled for July 21.  Within hours of learning the confidential details, Kinnucan had phone conversations or left messages with several clients to convey that F5?s revenues would exceed market expectations.  At least three clients ? an analyst and two portfolio managers ? caused trades at their respective investment advisory firms on the basis of Kinnucan?s inside information.  The insider trading resulted in profits or avoided losses of nearly $1.6 million. The SEC?s complaint, which charges Kinnucan and Broadband with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, requiring them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Joseph Sansone and Daniel Marcus ? members of the SEC?s Market Abuse Unit in New York ? and Matthew Watkins, Neil Hendelman, Diego Brucculeri and James D?Avino of the New York Regional Office.

694,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two China-based executives with defrauding investors into believing they were investing in a Chinese coal business when in fact they were investing in an empty shell company. The SEC alleges that Puda Coal Inc.?s chairman Ming Zhao schemed with former CEO Liping Zhu to steal and sell Puda Coal?s sole revenue-producing asset, a coal mining company named Shanxi Puda Coal Group.  Zhao secretly transferred Puda Coal?s controlling interest in Shanxi Coal to himself and then sold a substantial portion to a fund controlled by what is reported to be China?s largest state-owned financial firm.  The scheme enabled Zhao rather than Puda Coal?s public shareholders to profit from a lucrative business opportunity. The SEC alleges that Zhao and Zhu failed to disclose these transactions in Puda Coal?s periodic reports to the SEC, and continued to raise funds from U.S. investors by conducting two public offerings to purportedly raise capital to enable Shanxi Coal to acquire coal mines.  Unbeknownst to investors, Puda Coal no longer had an ownership stake in that company after Zhao?s secret maneuvers.  After the SEC began investigating, Zhao and Zhu further schemed to forge a letter from the Chinese financial firm purporting that Puda Coal investors weren?t harmed by the asset transfers.  In reality, the scheme left Puda Coal as a shell company with no ongoing business operations. ?Zhao and Zhu duped investors with promises that their money would be invested in a Chinese coal company when in fact the company was an empty shell that had been looted by the defendants,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?This enforcement action reflects our continuing commitment to hold accountable officers and directors of issuers who misuse their access to the U.S. capital markets to commit fraud for personal gain.? George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office, added, ?The massive fraud perpetrated by Zhao and Zhu wiped out hundreds of millions of dollars in shareholder value and was compounded by their brazen obstruction of the SEC?s investigation.?   According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Puda Coal entered the U.S. capital markets through a reverse merger in July 2005.  Puda Coal?s common stock was listed and traded on the NYSE Amex from September 2009 to August 2011.   The SEC alleges that Zhao embarked on the scheme with Zhu in September 2009 to enrich himself at the expense of Puda Coal?s public shareholders.  Just weeks before Puda Coal announced that Shanxi Coal had received a highly lucrative mandate from the provincial government authorities to become a consolidator of smaller coal mining companies, Zhao quietly transferred Puda Coal?s 90 percent stake in Shanxi Coal to himself.  In July 2010, Zhao transferred a 49 percent equity interest in Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co Ltd., a Chinese private equity fund controlled by state-owned investment firm CITIC Group.  CITIC Trust placed its 49 percent stake in Shanxi Coal in a trust and then sold interests in the trust to Chinese investors.  Zhao caused Shanxi Coal to pledge 51 percent of its assets to CITIC Trust as collateral for a loan of RMB 3.5 billion ($516 million in U.S. dollars) from the trust to Shanxi Coal.  In exchange, CITIC Trust gave Zhao 1.212 billion preferred shares in the trust.   According to the SEC?s complaint, the transactions were not approved by Puda Coal?s board or shareholders and not disclosed in Puda Coal?s SEC filings, which Zhao and Zhu signed knowing that they were materially false and misleading.  During the two Puda Coal public offerings in 2010, CITIC Trust was separately selling interests in Shanxi Coal to Chinese investors while Zhao and Zhu were still telling U.S. investors that Puda Coal owned a 90 percent stake in that company. The SEC further alleges that Zhao and Zhu continued their fraudulent scheme to deceive public investors even after the SEC began its investigation.  Zhu forged a letter purportedly from CITIC Trust falsely stating that no funds had actually been loaned to Shanxi Coal and disclaiming any interest in Puda Coal?s or Shanxi Coal?s assets.  Zhao?s counsel provided the forged letter to the SEC?s investigative staff and Puda?s audit committee.  After Puda Coal disclosed the letter in an SEC filing and further misled shareholders about the ownership of Puda Coal?s assets, Zhu admitted forging the letter and resigned as CEO.  Zhao remains the chairman. Zhao and Zhu are charged with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, as well as violating the proxy solicitation rules and various corporate reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act.  The SEC?s complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Zhao and Zhu to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, imposing financial penalties, barring them from acting as officers or directors of a public company, and permanently enjoining them from committing future violations of these provisions. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Sheldon Pollock, Scott York and George Stepaniuk of the SEC?s New York Regional Office with investigative support from Neil Hendelman and Desiree Marmita.  The SEC?s Cross Border Working Group, which has representatives from each of the SEC?s major divisions and offices and focuses on U.S. companies with substantial foreign operations, has assisted the New York Regional Office enforcement staff in the investigation.   *  *  * Over the past year, the SEC has moved to protect U.S. investors in U.S. companies with substantial foreign operations through:  Trading suspensions of at least 20 U.S. issuers based abroad.? Stop orders against two U.S. issuers based abroad to prevent further stock sales under materially misleading and deficient offering documents.? Filing a subpoena enforcement action against a foreign-based audit firm to obtain documents.

695,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three oil services executives with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by participating in a bribery scheme to obtain illicit permits for oil rigs in Nigeria in order to retain business under lucrative drilling contracts.    The SEC alleges that former Noble Corporation CEO Mark A. Jackson along with James J. Ruehlen, who is the current Director and Division Manager of Noble?s subsidiary in Nigeria, bribed customs officials to process false paperwork purporting to show the export and re-import of oil rigs, when in fact the rigs never moved. The scheme was designed to save Noble Corporation from losing business and incurring significant costs associated with exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them under new permits. Bribes were paid through a customs agent for Noble?s Nigerian subsidiary with Jackson and Ruehlen?s approval.    The SEC separately charged Thomas F. O?Rourke, who was a former controller and head of internal audit at Noble. The SEC alleges that O?Rourke helped approve the bribe payments and allowed the bribes to be booked improperly as legitimate operating expenses for the company. O?Rourke agreed to settle the SEC?s charges and pay a penalty.    ?These executives knowingly authorized and paid foreign officials to process false documents, and they consciously concealed the scheme from Noble?s audit committee,? said Gerald Hodgkins, Associate Director in the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?When executives bribe government officials overseas, their misconduct puts their companies in legal peril and damages the integrity of foreign markets and the reputation of U.S. companies abroad.?    Noble Corporation was charged with FCPA violations as part of a sweep of the oil services industry in late 2010. The company cooperated with investigators and agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle civil and criminal cases.    According to the SEC?s complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the executives who perpetrated the scheme worked at Noble Corporation and its Nigerian subsidiary Noble Drilling (Nigeria) Ltd, whose rigs operated in Nigeria on the basis of temporary import permits granted by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). These temporary permits allowed the rigs to be in the country for a one-year period. NCS had the discretion to grant up to three extensions lasting six months each, after which the rigs were required to be exported and re-imported under a new temporary permit or be permanently imported with the payment of sizeable duties.    The SEC alleges that Jackson and Ruehlen had a role in arranging, facilitating, approving, making, or concealing the bribe payments to induce Nigerian customs officials to grant new temporary permits illegally and favorably exercise or abuse their discretion to grant permit extensions. Together, Jackson and Ruehlen participated in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to obtain about 11 illicit permits and 29 permit extensions. Jackson approved the bribe payments and concealed the payments from Noble?s audit committee and auditors. Ruehlen prepared false documents, sought approval for the bribes, and processed and paid the bribes.    The SEC?s complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen alleges they directly violated the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act and the internal controls and false records provisions at Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that they aided and abetted Noble?s violations of Section 30A and the books and records and internal controls provisions at Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The complaint further alleges that Jackson directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by misleading auditors and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false certifications of Noble?s financial statements. He also is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions by Noble, Ruehlen, and O?Rourke.    The SEC?s complaint against O?Rourke alleges that he aided and abetted Noble?s violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, and that he directly violated the internal controls and false records provisions of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC?s allegations, O?Rourke consented to entry of a court order requiring him to pay a $35,000 penalty and permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1.    The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Moira T. Roberts, Sharan K.S. Custer, and Colin Rand, and the litigation effort will be led by Kenneth W. Donnelly.

696,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two managers of private investment funds established solely to acquire the shares of Facebook and other Silicon Valley firms with misleading investors and pocketing undisclosed fees and commissions.  The SEC alleges that the fund managers collectively raised more than $70 million from investors. Separately, the SEC charged SharesPost, an online service that matches buyers and sellers of pre-IPO stock, with engaging in securities transactions without registering as a broker-dealer. The charges stem from the SEC?s yearlong investigation of the fast-growing business of trading pre-IPO shares on the secondary market. ?While we applaud innovation in the capital markets, new platforms and products must obey the rules and ensure the basic fairness and disclosure that are the hallmarks of sound financial regulation,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ?Fund managers must fully disclose their compensation and material conflicts of interest.  Investors deserve better than the kind of undisclosed self-dealing present in these cases,? said Robert Kaplan, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit. SEC v. Frank Mazzola, Felix Investments LLC, and Facie Libre Management Associates LLC The SEC alleges that Mazzola, who lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., and his firms created two funds to buy securities of Facebook and other high profile technology companies.  However, Mazzola and his firms engaged in improper self-dealing ? earning secret commissions above the 5 percent disclosed in offering materials on the funds? acquisition of Facebook stock and on re-sales of fund interests to new investors.  The hidden charges essentially raised the prices paid by their investors for Facebook stock because it created a disincentive for Mazzola and his firms to negotiate a lower price for fund investors.  They also sold Facie Libre fund interests despite knowing the funds lacked ownership of certain Facebook shares.   According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Mazzola and his firms also made false statements to investors in other funds they created to invest in various pre-IPO companies.  For instance, they misled one investor into believing a Felix fund had successfully acquired stock of Zynga.  They also made false representations about Twitter?s revenue to attract investors to their Twitter fund. The SEC?s lawsuit against Mazzola, Felix Investments, and Facie Libre seeks court orders prohibiting them from engaging in securities fraud and requiring them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and pay financial penalties. In the Matter of EB Financial Group LLC and Laurence Albukerk According to the SEC?s administrative proceeding against Laurence Albukerk, who lives in San Francisco, he and his firm hid from investors significant compensation earned in connection with two Facebook funds they managed.  In written offering materials for the funds, Albukerk told investors he charged only a 5 percent fee for an initial investment and a 5 percent fee when the shares were distributed to fund investors upon a Facebook IPO.  However, Albukerk obtained additional compensation by using an entity controlled by his wife to purchase the Facebook stock and then buying interests in that entity for the EB Funds while charging investors a mark-up.  Albukerk also earned a brokerage fee on the acquisition of Facebook shares from the original stockholders.  As a result of the fee and mark-up, investors in Albukerk?s two Facebook funds ultimately paid significantly more than the fees disclosed in the offering materials. Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, Albukerk and EB Financial consented to entry of a SEC order finding that they violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Albukerk and EB Financial also agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $210,499 and a penalty of $100,000. In the Matter of SharesPost Inc. and Greg Brogger According to the SEC?s administrative proceeding against SharesPost and its CEO Greg Brogger of Park City, Utah, the online platform facilitated securities transactions without registering with the SEC as a broker-dealer.  SharesPost engaged in a series of activities that constituted the business of effecting securities transactions and thus were required to register as a broker-dealer.  SharesPost held itself out to the public as an online service to help match buyers and sellers of pre-IPO stock and allowed registered representatives of other broker-dealers to hold themselves out as SharesPost employees and earn commissions on transactions they facilitated through the SharesPost platform.  SharesPost and affiliated broker-dealers also created a commission pool that was distributed by an executive to employees who were representatives of these broker-dealers.  The company also collected and published on its website third-party information concerning issuers? financial metrics, SharesPost-funded research reports, and a SharesPost-created valuation index.  Additionally, the SharesPost platform was used to create an auction process for interests in funds managed by a SharesPost affiliate and designed to buy stock in pre-IPO companies. ?The newly emerging secondary marketplace for pre-IPO stock presents risk for even savvy investors,? said Marc Fagel, Director of the SEC?s San Francisco Regional Office.  ?Broker-dealer registration helps ensure those who effect securities transactions can be relied upon to understand and faithfully execute their obligations to customers and the markets.  SharesPost skirted these important provisions.? SharesPost and Brogger consented to an SEC order finding that SharesPost committed and Brogger caused a violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934.  They agreed to pay penalties of $80,000 and $20,000 respectively.  Subsequent to the SEC?s investigation, SharesPost acquired a broker-dealer and its membership agreement was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). These cases were investigated by Michael E. Liftik, Erin E. Schneider and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office.  Ms. Schneider and Mr. Leach are members of the SEC?s Asset Management Unit.

697,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Warsaw, Ind.-based medical device company Biomet Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries and agents bribed public doctors in Argentina, Brazil, and China for nearly a decade to win business.    Biomet, which primarily sells products used by orthopedic surgeons, agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle the SEC?s charges as well as parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. The charges arise from the SEC and DOJ?s ongoing proactive global investigation into medical device companies bribing publicly-employed physicians.    The SEC alleges that Biomet and its four subsidiaries paid bribes from 2000 to August 2008, and employees and managers at all levels of the parent company and the subsidiaries were involved along with the distributors who sold Biomet?s products. Biomet?s compliance and internal audit functions failed to stop the payments to doctors even after learning about the illegal practices.    ?Biomet?s misconduct came to light because of the government?s proactive investigation of bribery within the medical device industry,? said Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the Enforcement Division?s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ?A company?s compliance and internal audit should be the first line of defense against corruption, not part of the problem.?    According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., employees of Biomet Argentina SA paid kickbacks as high as 15 to 20 percent of each sale to publicly-employed doctors in Argentina. Phony invoices were used to justify the payments, and the bribes were falsely recorded as ?consulting fees? or ?commissions? in Biomet?s books and records. Executives and internal auditors at Biomet?s Indiana headquarters were aware of the payments as early as 2000, but failed to stop it.    The SEC alleges that Biomet?s U.S. subsidiary Biomet International used a distributor to bribe publicly-employed doctors in Brazil by paying them as much as 10 to 20 percent of the value of their medical device purchases. Payments were openly discussed in communications between the distributor, Biomet International employees, and Biomet?s executives and internal auditors in the U.S. For example, a February 2002 internal Biomet memorandum about a limited audit of the distributor?s books stated:  Brazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as a kickback. These payments are made in cash that allows the surgeon to receive income tax free. ?The accounting entry is to increase a prepaid expense account. In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these payments were reclassified to expense in the income statement.     According to the SEC?s complaint, two additional subsidiaries ? Biomet China and Scandimed AB ? sold medical devices through a distributor in China who provided publicly-employed doctors with money and travel in exchange for their purchases of Biomet products. Beginning as early as 2001, the distributor exchanged e-mails with Biomet employees that explicitly described the bribes he was arranging on the company?s behalf. For example, one e-mail stated:  [Doctor] is the department head of [public hospital]. [Doctor] uses about 10 hips and knees a month and it?s on an uptrend, as he told us over dinner a week ago. ?Many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his. A kind word on Biomet from him goes a long way for us. Dinner has been set for the evening of the 24th. It will be nice. But dinner aside, I?ve got to send him to Switzerland to visit his daughter.     The SEC alleges that some e-mails described the way that vendors would deliver cash to surgeons upon completion of surgery, and others discussed the amount of payments. The distributor explained in one e-mail that 25 percent in cash would be delivered to a surgeon upon completion of surgery. Biomet sponsored travel for 20 Chinese surgeons in 2007 to Spain, where a substantial part of the trip was devoted to sightseeing and other entertainment.    Biomet consented to the entry of a court order requiring payment of $4,432,998 in disgorgement and $1,142,733 in prejudgment interest. Biomet also is ordered to retain an independent compliance consultant for 18 months to review its FCPA compliance program, and is permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Biomet agreed to pay a $17.28 million fine to settle the criminal charges.    The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Brent S. Mitchell with Tracy L.

698,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged twin brothers from the U.K. with defrauding approximately 75,000 investors through an Internet-based pump-and-dump scheme in which they touted a fake ?stock picking robot? that purportedly identified penny stocks set to double in price. Instead, the brothers were merely touting stocks they were being paid separately to promote. The SEC alleges that Alexander John Hunter and Thomas Edward Hunter were just 16 years old when they set their fraud in motion beginning in 2007. They disseminated e-mail newsletters through a pair of websites they created to tout stocks selected by the robot ? which they described as a highly sophisticated computer trading program that was the product of extensive research and development. Their claims were persuasive as the Hunters received at least $1.2 million from investors primarily in the U.S. who paid $47 apiece for annual newsletter subscriptions. Some investors paid an additional fee for the ?home version? of the robot software.  In reality, the SEC alleges that the Hunters used a third website to offer their services as stock promoters, claiming that they could ?rocket? a stock?s price and increase its volume by sending out newsletters. The Hunters were consequently paid at least $1.865 million in fees from known or suspected stock promoters, and they did not disclose to their newsletter followers the conflicting relationship between their two businesses. ?The Hunters used the anonymity of the Internet and the promise of easy riches to prey on investors,? said Thomas A. Sporkin, Chief of the SEC?s Office of Market Intelligence. ?While touting their supposed breakthrough investment technology on two websites, the Hunters were racking up fees as stock promoters through a third.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Hunters created websites Doublingstocks.com and Daytradingrobot.com to falsely tout that a former trading algorithm programmer from a large investment bank had designed a stock picking robot that they named ? Marl.? The robot could purportedly analyze the over-the-counter securities markets and identify penny stocks that were set to experience large price increases. The brothers offered investors paid subscriptions to their e-mail newsletter that would contain the robot?s latest stock pick.  The SEC alleges that the brothers separately created the website Equitypromoter.com where they marketed their newsletter subscriber list to penny stock promoters and boasted, ?One email to this list of people rockets a stock price.? The Hunters were in turn paid to send selected penny stock ticker symbols to their subscribers, who were misled to believe that the stock ?picks? were the product of the robot. The Hunters sent out their newsletters near the beginning of the trading day, and the price and volume of the promoted stocks spiked dramatically as newsletter subscribers rushed to purchase shares. However, the stocks typically fell precipitously shortly thereafter, leaving investors with shares worth less than they had purchased them for earlier in the day. According to the SEC?s complaint, the Hunters also offered subscribers a downloadable version of the stock picking robot for an additional fee of $97. Rather than performing the analysis advertised, the software was actually designed to just deliver users a stock pick supplied by the brothers. In soliciting bids in 2007 from free-lance coders to create the software, Alexander Hunter wrote that the software should ?not actually find stocks at all. It should connect to my database and simply request any new stocks I have put in.? He bluntly explained that the software ?is almost a ?fake? piece of software and needs to simply appear advanced to the user.? Like the newsletter, the home version of the stock picking robot was no more than a fraudulent delivery vehicle for stock symbols that the Hunters had been compensated to promote. The SEC?s complaint charges the Hunters with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the U.S. securities laws, namely Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

699,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former executive at Morgan Stanley with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as well as securities laws for investment advisers by secretly acquiring millions of dollars worth of real estate investments for himself and an influential Chinese official who in turn steered business to Morgan Stanley?s funds. The SEC alleges that Garth R. Peterson, who was a managing director in Morgan Stanley?s real estate investment and fund advisory business, had a personal friendship and secret business relationship with the former Chairman of Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co. ? a Chinese state-owned entity with influence over the success of Morgan Stanley?s real estate business in Shanghai.  Peterson secretly arranged to have at least $1.8 million paid to himself and the Chinese official that he disguised as finder?s fees that Morgan Stanley?s funds owed to third parties.  Peterson also secretly arranged for him, the Chinese official, and an attorney to acquire a valuable Shanghai real estate interest from a Morgan Stanley fund.  Peterson was acquiring an interest from the fund but negotiated both sides of the transaction.  In exchange for offers and payments from Peterson, the Chinese official helped Peterson and Morgan Stanley obtain business while personally benefitting from some of these same investments.  Peterson?s deception, self-dealing, and misappropriation breached the fiduciary duties he owed to Morgan Stanley?s funds as their representative.  Peterson agreed to a settlement of the SEC?s charges in which he will be permanently barred from the securities industry, pay more than $250,000 in disgorgement, and relinquish his interest in the valuable Shanghai real estate (currently valued at approximately $3.4 million) that he secretly acquired through his misconduct.  The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a related criminal case against Peterson. ?Peterson crossed the line not once, but twice.  He secretly bribed a government official to illegally win business for his employer and enriched himself in violation of his fiduciary duty to Morgan Stanley?s clients,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?This case illustrates the SEC?s commitment to holding individuals accountable for FCPA violations, particularly employees who intentionally circumvent their company's internal controls.? Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit, added, ?As a rogue employee who took advantage of his firm and its investment advisory clients, Peterson orchestrated a scheme to illegally win business while lining his own pockets and those of an influential Chinese official.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Peterson?s violations occurred from at least 2004 to 2007.  His principal responsibility at Morgan Stanley was to evaluate, negotiate, acquire, manage and sell real estate investments on behalf of Morgan Stanley?s advisers and funds.  He was terminated in 2008 due to his FCPA misconduct.   The SEC alleges that Peterson led Morgan Stanley?s effort to build a Chinese real estate investment portfolio for its real estate funds by cultivating a relationship with the Chinese official and taking advantage of his ability to steer opportunities to Morgan Stanley and his influence in helping with needed governmental approvals.  Morgan Stanley thus partnered with Yongye on a number of significant Chinese real estate investments.  At the same time, Peterson and the Chinese official expanded their personal business dealings both in a real estate interest secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley as well as by investing together in Chinese franchises of well-known U.S. fast food restaurants.  Peterson failed to disclose these investments in annual disclosures that Morgan Stanley required him to make as part of his employment. According to the SEC?s complaint, Peterson openly credited the Chinese official with helping obtain approvals required from other Chinese government entities for a deal to close.  He wrote to several Morgan Stanley employees in response to an e-mail discussing the terms of one of Yongye?s purported investments, ?Everyone pls keep in mind the big picture here.  YY gave us this deal. ... So we owe them a favor relating to this deal. ... This should be very easy and friendly.?  In another e-mail a week later, Peterson described ?YYI? as ?our friends who are coming in because WE OWE THEM A FAVOR.?   The SEC alleges that a Morgan Stanley compliance officer specifically informed Peterson in 2004 that employees of Yongye, a Chinese state-owned entity, were government officials for purposes of the FCPA.  Peterson also received at least 35 FCPA compliance reminders from Morgan Stanley, but nonetheless committed the FCPA violations. The SEC?s complaint charges Peterson with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA, and with aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Peterson consented to a court order requiring him to disgorge $254,589 and relinquish to a court-appointed receiver the interest he secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley?s fund in the Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments.  Peterson?s interest has a current estimated value of approximately $3.4 million.  The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.  Peterson also has consented to permanent industry bars based on the anticipated entry of the injunctions against him and his criminal conviction.   The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DOJ?s Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Morgan Stanley, which is not charged in the matter, cooperated with the SEC?s inquiry and conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and other misconduct involved. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by David Neuman of the Asset Management Unit and Assistant Director Greg Faragasso, and the litigation was led by Richard Hong.",-0.14285714285714285,Negative
700,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an enforcement action against Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd. for its refusal to provide the agency with audit work papers related to a China-based company under investigation for potential accounting fraud against U.S. investors.    According to the SEC?s order instituting administrative proceedings against D&T Shanghai, the agency has been making extensive efforts for more than two years to obtain documents related to the firm?s work for the company, which issues U.S. securities registered with the SEC. The firm is charged with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires foreign public accounting firms to provide audit work papers concerning U.S. issuers to the SEC upon request. D&T Shanghai has nonetheless failed to provide the documents, citing Chinese law as the reason for its refusal.    ?As a voluntarily registered U.S. public accounting firm, D&T Shanghai cannot benefit from the financial and reputational rewards that come with auditing U.S. issuers without also meeting its U.S. legal obligations,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Foreign firms auditing U.S. issuers should not be permitted to shield themselves from regulatory scrutiny to the detriment of U.S. investors.?    Scott Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement, added, ?Without access to work papers of foreign public accounting firms, our investigators are unable to test the quality of the underlying audits and fulfill our responsibilities to investors.?    In a separate matter last year, the SEC filed a subpoena enforcement action against D&T Shanghai in federal court after the firm failed to produce documents in response to a subpoena related to an SEC investigation into possible fraud by one of its longtime clients, Longtop Financial Technologies Limited. The SEC later filed charges against Longtop for alleged reporting failures.    According to the SEC?s order in this latest enforcement action, D&T Shanghai is a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). In April 2010, SEC staff began seeking D&T Shanghai?s audit work papers related to its independent audit work for the client involved in an SEC investigation. The SEC served Deloitte LLP, the U.S. member firm, with a subpoena requesting various related documents. Counsel for Deloitte LLP informed the staff that the U.S. firm did not perform any audit work for the client and therefore did not possess the documents related to the subpoena.    According to the SEC?s order, in the SEC staff?s continuing quest for the audit work papers in D&T Shanghai?s possession, they were later informed by counsel for Deloitte?s global firm that the agency?s request for audit work papers had been specifically communicated to D&T Shanghai. Subsequently, the staff served D&T Shanghai with a request through Deloitte LLP for the audit work papers pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. D&T Shanghai would not produce the relevant audit work papers because of its interpretation that it is prevented from doing so by Chinese law. SEC staff also has sought to obtain the relevant audit work papers through international sharing mechanisms, yet these efforts have been unsuccessful.    This is the first time the Commission has brought an enforcement action against a foreign audit firm for failing to comply with a Section 106 request.    In the SEC?s order, the Enforcement Division alleges that D&T Shanghai willfully violated the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to provide the SEC with the audit work papers. The administrative proceeding will be assigned to an Administrative Law Judge at the agency. The judge would determine the appropriate remedial sanctions if the judge finds in favor of the SEC staff.",-0.391304347826087,Negative
701,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tai Nguyen, the owner of the California-based equity research firm Insight Research, with insider trading.  The charges stem from the SEC?s ongoing investigation of insider trading involving so-called ?expert networks? that provide specialized information to investment firms. The SEC alleges that from 2006 through 2009, Nguyen frequently traded in the securities of Abaxis, Inc. based on inside information he received from a close relative employed at Abaxis.  Nguyen repeatedly traded for himself in advance of the company?s quarterly earnings announcements while in possession of key data in those announcements, reaping tens of thousands of dollars in illicit profits.  Nguyen also passed that same information to hedge fund clients of Insight Research, who used the inside information to make millions of dollars in profits from trading Abaxis securities. ?Nguyen claimed expertise in researching and analyzing technology companies, but his special edge was his willingness to break the law,? said Sanjay Wadhwa, Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office and Deputy Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.  ?Like many other so-called ?experts? who trafficked in inside information, Nguyen now finds himself the subject of an enforcement action.? The SEC has charged 23 defendants in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms.  The insider trading alleged by the SEC has yielded illicit gains of more than $117 million, chiefly in shares of technology companies, including Apple, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Marvell Technology. According to the SEC?s complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Nguyen regularly obtained material nonpublic information about Abaxis Inc.?s quarterly earnings  ? including revenues, gross profit margins and earnings per share ? from a relative who worked in Abaxis?s finance department.  Nguyen used the information to trade Abaxis securities in his own account and reaped approximately $145,000 in illicit trading profits from 2006 through 2009.   In addition to trading in his own account, the SEC alleges that Nguyen passed the inside information to New York-based Barai Capital Management and Boston-based Sonar Capital Management, both of which were clients of Nguyen?s firm, Insight Research.  The two hedge fund managers ? who collectively were paying Insight Research tens of thousands of dollars each month ? traded Abaxis securities based on the inside information that Nguyen provided and reaped more than $7.2 million in illicit gains for their hedge funds.   The SEC?s complaint charges Nguyen with violating the anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws and seeks a final judgment ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, with interest, and pay financial penalties, and permanently barring him from future violations. The SEC?s investigation is continuing.  Daniel Marcus and Joseph Sansone, members of the SEC?s Market Abuse Unit in New York, conducted the investigation, along with Matthew Watkins, Neil Hendelman, Diego Brucculeri, and James D?Avino of the New York Regional Office.

702,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Peter Madoff, the brother of Bernie Madoff, with committing fraud, making false statements to regulators, and falsifying books and records in order to create the false appearance of a functioning compliance program over Madoff?s fraudulent investment advisory operations. The SEC alleges that Peter Madoff, who served as Chief Compliance Officer and Senior Managing Director at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) from 1969 to December 2008, created stacks of compliance documents setting out supposedly robust policies and procedures over BMIS?s investment advisory operations. However, Peter Madoff created these compliance manuals, written supervisory procedures, reports of annual compliance reviews, and compliance certifications to merely paper the file. No policies and procedures were ever implemented, and none of the reviews were actually performed even though Peter Madoff represented that he personally completed the reviews. The U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Peter Madoff. ?Peter Madoff helped Bernie Madoff create the image of a functioning compliance program purportedly overseen by sophisticated financial professionals,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Tragically, the image was merely an illusion supported by Peter?s sham paperwork and false filings for which he was rewarded with tens of millions of dollars in stolen investor funds.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bernie Madoff realized in late 2008 that his decades-long scheme was on the verge of collapse. He told Peter Madoff that he could not pay billions of dollars of investor redemption requests and wanted to distribute remaining investor money to family, friends, and favored employees before the scheme collapsed. Peter Madoff then helped choose which family, friends and employees to pay, and rushed to withdraw $200,000 from BMIS?s bank account for himself before the fraud?s final downfall. The SEC alleges that in addition to creating false compliance materials, Peter Madoff created false broker-dealer and investment advisor registration applications filed by BMIS. He also failed to implement and review required policies and procedures, and falsified the firm?s books and records. Peter Madoff was richly rewarded for his misconduct, pocketing tens of millions of dollars through salary and bonuses, fake trades, sham loans, and direct, undocumented transfers of investor funds to himself from the bank account that BMIS used to perpetrate the Ponzi scheme. The SEC?s complaint against Peter Madoff alleges that by engaging in this conduct, he violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 15(b)(1), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 15b3-1 and 17a-3 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring Peter Madoff to disgorge his ill-gotten gains. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Aaron P. Arnzen and Kristine M. Zaleskas of the New York Regional Office.

703,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the U.S. investment banking subsidiary of Japan-based Mizuho Financial Group and three former employees with misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) by using ?dummy assets? to inflate the deal?s credit ratings.  The SEC also charged the firm that served as the deal?s collateral manager and the person who was its portfolio manager. According to the SEC?s complaint against Mizuho Securities USA Inc., the firm made approximately $10 million in structuring and marketing fees in the deal.  Mizuho agreed to pay $127.5 million to settle the SEC?s charges, and the others charged also agreed to settle the SEC?s actions against them. The SEC alleges that Mizuho structured and marketed Delphinus CDO 2007-1, a CDO that was backed by subprime bonds at a time when the housing market was showing signs of severe distress.  The deal was contingent upon Mizuho obtaining credit ratings it used to market the notes to investors.  When its employees realized that Delphinus could not meet one rating agency?s newly announced criteria intended to protect CDO investors from the uncertainty of ratings downgrades, they submitted to the rating firm a portfolio containing millions of dollars in dummy assets that inaccurately reflected the collateral held by Delphinus.  Once the firm rated the inaccurate portfolio, Mizuho closed the transaction and sold the notes to investors using the misleading ratings.  Delphinus defaulted in 2008 and eventually was liquidated in 2010.  Mizuho sustained substantial losses from Delphinus. ?This case demonstrates once again that bankers and market participants who embrace a ?get the deal done at all costs? strategy will be identified, charged, and punished,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?This is a constant theme throughout the many SEC enforcement actions arising out of the financial crisis, and is one that everyone involved in securities transactions and our financial markets would be well-advised to respect.? Kenneth Lench, Chief of the SEC?s Enforcement Division?s Structured and New Products Unit, added, ?Mizuho and its employees undermined the integrity of the rating process by furnishing inaccurate information about the Delphinus portfolio.  Investors expect and are entitled to receive legitimate ratings in order to help them assess their investments.? According to the SEC?s settled administrative proceedings against the three former Mizuho employees responsible for the Delphinus deal, Alexander Rekeda headed the group that structured the $1.6 billion CDO, Xavier Capdepon modeled the transaction for the rating agencies, and Gwen Snorteland was the transaction manager responsible for structuring and closing Delphinus.  Delaware Asset Advisers (DAA) served as Delphinus?s collateral manager and the DAA portfolio manager was Wei (Alex) Wei. According to the SEC?s complaint against Mizuho filed in federal court in Manhattan, all of the collateral assets for Delphinus had been purchased by July 17, 2007, and the transaction was scheduled to close on July 19.  However, around noon on July 18, Standard & Poor?s (S&P) issued a press release announcing changes to its CDO rating criteria requiring certain categories of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to be adjusted downward for purposes of calculating their default probability.  The Mizuho employees knew that Delphinus?s actual portfolio contained a substantial amount of RMBS that were subject to the downward ratings, and that Delphinus, as constructed, could not meet its rating targets under these tougher standards.  To enable Delphinus to close anyway, the Mizuho employees e-mailed multiple alternative portfolios to S&P that contained dummy assets that were superior in credit quality to the assets that had been actually acquired for the CDO.  Once the necessary ratings were secured by the use of dummy assets, the Delphinus transaction closed by mid-afternoon on July 19 and securities were sold based upon these higher ratings.  Investors were thus misled to believe that the Delphinus notes had achieved the advertised ratings that the actual closing portfolio would not support. According to the SEC?s complaint, in connection with Delphinus?s subsequent request for a required rating confirmation from S&P, Mizuho employees provided and arranged for others to provide further inaccurate information about the composition of Delphinus?s assets.  Primarily, they misrepresented that Delphinus?s effective date was August 6 rather than July 19.  S&P then provided Delphinus with the ratings confirmation using the improper effective date of August 6.  Everyone charged by the SEC agreed to settlements without admitting or denying the charges.  Mizuho consented to the entry of a final judgment requiring payment of $10 million in disgorgement, $2.5 million in prejudgment interest, and a $115 million penalty.  The settlement, which requires court approval, also permanently enjoins Mizuho from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act. In the related administrative proceedings against Rekeda, Capdepon, and Snorteland, the SEC found that Rekeda violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Capdepon and Snorteland violated Section 17(a).  Rekeda and Capdepon each agreed to pay a $125,000 penalty while the decision on whether there will be a penalty for Snorteland will be decided at a later date.  Rekeda agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for 12 months, Capdepon and Snorteland each agreed to be barred from the securities industry for one year, and all three agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the respective sections of the Securities Act they violated. The SEC instituted settled administrative proceedings against DAA and Wei based on their post-closing conduct.  DAA consented to the entry of an order requiring the firm to pay disgorgement of $2,228,372, prejudgment interest of $357,776, and a penalty of $2,228,372.  Wei consented to the entry of an order requiring him to pay a $50,000 penalty and suspending him from associating with any investment adviser for six months.  Both DAA and Wei consented to cease and desist from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

705,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb with insider trading on confidential information about companies being targeted for potential acquisitions. His illegal trading took place as recently as just weeks ago. The SEC alleges that Robert D. Ramnarine, who lives in East Brunswick, N.J., made more than $300,000 in illegal profits by misusing nonpublic information he obtained while helping Bristol-Myers Squibb evaluate whether to acquire three other pharmaceutical companies. He used multiple personal brokerage accounts to illegally trade in stock options of these potential target companies. Prior to some trading, Ramnarine conducted Internet research from his Bristol computer to determine whether he could be detected by regulators. He searched for such phrases as ?can stock option be traced to purchaser? and ?illegal insider trading options trace? and viewed such articles as ?Ways to Avoid Insider Trading.? Ramnarine even viewed a press release on the SEC?s website announcing an enforcement action arising from illegal trading in call options in advance of an acquisition announcement. ?Ramnarine tried to educate himself about how the SEC investigates insider trading so he could avoid detection, but apparently he ignored countless successful SEC enforcement actions against similarly ill-motivated individuals who paid a heavy price for their illegal trading,? said Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit. ?Executives at pharmaceutical companies or in any industry should know better than to abuse confidential, market-moving information, and our charges against Ramnarine should serve notice that when you violate insider trading laws, no matter how you scheme, you will be caught.? The SEC is seeking a court order to freeze Ramnarine?s brokerage account assets. In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the District of New Jersey announced the arrest of Ramnarine today. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey, Ramnarine is an executive in the treasury department at Bristol-Myers Squibb. He conducted his insider trading schemes from August 2010 to July 2012, illegally trading in stock options of Pharmasset Inc., Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., and ZymoGenetics Inc. in advance of announcements that those companies would be acquired. The SEC alleges that just as Bristol was finalizing its agreement with ZymoGenetics in late August 2010, Ramnarine started to buy out-of-the-money call options. A call option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock of the issuer and gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specified period of time. Typically, investors will purchase call options when they believe the stock of the underlying securities is going up. Ramnarine made $30,551 in illegal profits by trading ZymoGenetics call options in advance of a Sept. 7, 2010 public announcement that Bristol-Myers Squibb was acquiring ZymoGenetics. The SEC further alleges that in advance of a Nov. 21, 2011 announcement that Pharmasset would be acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc., Ramnarine bought Pharmasset call options based on material, nonpublic information that he obtained from participating in Bristol-Myers Squibb?s evaluation of a possible acquisition of Pharmasset. This was part of an auction process conducted by Pharmasset and its investment bankers during the weeks before the Gilead-Pharmasset announcement. Ramnarine made $225,026 in illegal profits when he sold the calls immediately after the public announcement of Pharmasset?s sale. According to the SEC?s complaint, Ramnarine very recently sold or ?wrote? put options and purchased call options in advance of a June 29, 2012 announcement by Bristol-Myers Squibb that it would acquire Amylin. A put option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock. When investors sell or ?write? puts, they obligate themselves to sell the underlying security at a certain price before the expiration date. Investors usually write puts when they believe the price of the underlying stock price is moving up. Ramnarine?s trades were based on material nonpublic information that he obtained by working on financing and capital structure matters as part of Bristol?s due diligence process leading up to the acquisition announcement. Ramnarine made $55,784 in illegal profits by trading Amylin put and call options in advance of the public announcement. The SEC alleges that Ramnarine violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and (14)(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a financial penalty, an officer-and-director bar, a permanent injunction, and an order freezing the assets in Ramnarine?s brokerage accounts.

Corporation agreed to pay a $15 million penalty to resolve its investigation of FCPA violations. ?Pfizer subsidiaries in several countries had bribery so entwined in their sales culture that they offered points and bonus programs to improperly reward foreign officials who proved to be their best customers,? said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ?These charges illustrate the pitfalls that exist for companies that fail to appropriately monitor potential risks in their global operations.? According to the SEC?s complaint against Pfizer filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the misconduct dates back as far as 2001. Employees of Pfizer?s subsidiaries authorized and made cash payments and provided other incentives to bribe government doctors to utilize Pfizer products. In China, for example, Pfizer employees invited ?high-prescribing doctors? in the Chinese government to club-like meetings that included extensive recreational and entertainment activities to reward doctors? past product sales or prescriptions. Pfizer China also created various ?point programs? under which government doctors could accumulate points based on the number of Pfizer prescriptions they wrote. The points were redeemed for various gifts ranging from medical books to cell phones, tea sets, and reading glasses. In Croatia, Pfizer employees created a ?bonus program? for Croatian doctors who were employed in senior positions in Croatian government health care institutions. Once a doctor agreed to use Pfizer products, a percentage of the value purchased by a doctor?s institution would be funneled back to the doctor in the form of cash, international travel, or free products. According to the SEC?s complaint, Pfizer made an initial voluntary disclosure of misconduct by its subsidiaries to the SEC and Department of Justice in October 2004, and fully cooperated with SEC investigators. Pfizer took such extensive remedial actions as undertaking a comprehensive worldwide review of its compliance program. The SEC further alleges that Wyeth subsidiaries engaged in FCPA violations primarily before but also after the company?s acquisition by Pfizer in late 2009. Starting at least in 2005, subsidiaries marketing Wyeth nutritional products in China, Indonesia, and Pakistan bribed government doctors to recommend their products to patients by making cash payments or in some cases providing BlackBerrys and cell phones or travel incentives. They often used fictitious invoices to conceal the true nature of the payments. In Saudi Arabia, Wyeth?s subsidiary made an improper cash payment to a customs official to secure the release of a shipment of promotional items used for marketing purposes. The promotional items were held in port because Wyeth Saudi Arabia had failed to secure a required Saudi Arabian Standards Organization Certificate of Conformity. Following Pfizer?s acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer undertook a risk-based FCPA due diligence review of Wyeth?s global operations and voluntarily reported the findings to the SEC staff. Pfizer diligently and promptly integrated Wyeth?s legacy operations into its compliance program and cooperated fully with SEC investigators. In settling the SEC?s charges, Wyeth neither admitted nor denied the allegations. Pfizer consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of $16,032,676 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $10,307,268 for a total of $26,339,944. Wyeth also is required to report to the SEC on the status of its remediation and implementation of compliance measures over a two-year period, and is permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Wyeth consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of $17,217,831 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $1,658,793, for a total of $18,876,624. As a Pfizer subsidiary, the status of Wyeth?s remediation and implementation of compliance measures will be subsumed in Pfizer?s two-year self-reporting period. Wyeth also is permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Michael Catoe and Charles Cain of the Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit.

707,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a  China-based company and its chief executive with fraud for recording fake sales  of a weight loss product to inflate revenues in the company?s financial  statements by millions of dollars. The SEC alleges that China Sky One Medical Inc. (CSKI)  falsely stated in 2007 annual and quarterly reports that it had entered into a  strategic distribution agreement with a Malaysian company that would become the  ?exclusive? distributor of CSKI?s ?slim  patch? in Malaysia  and generate $1 million per month in sales.? However, the company never actually entered  into any such agreement.? CSKI instead  created approximately $19.8 million in phony export sales to Malaysia that  were recorded as revenue in its financial results for 2007 and 2008.? CEO Yan-qing Liu certified the overstated  financial results, which appear in CSKI?s financial statements through 2010 and  continue to impact the company?s retained earnings on its balance sheet.?  ?Accurate and reliable financial reporting is the bedrock of  our capital markets, but CSKI made a mockery of that by blatantly fabricating sales and overstating its  financial results,? said John M. McCoy III, Associate  Director of the SEC?s Los Angeles Regional Office  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District  Court for the Central District of California, CSKI is based Harbin, China.? In addition to weight loss patches, the  company produces and sells sprays, ointments, and other Chinese traditional pain  relief and health and beauty products.?  CSKI became a public company trading on the U.S.  markets through a reverse merger in May 2006. The SEC alleges that after CSKI devised the purported  strategic distribution agreement with Takasima Industries ? which is a  Malaysian fitness equipment manufacturer and retailer ? CSKI went on to falsely  report export sales to Malaysia of more than $12.2 million for 2007, which  constituted 25 percent of its total revenues.?  CSKI then falsely recorded $7.5 million (8.2 percent of total revenues)  in such sales for 2008.? Virtually all of CSKI?s reported sales to Malaysia via Takasima were  bogus.? Takasima only purchased $167,542 in slim patches from CSKI in 2007, and none in 2008.? And it never entered into any distribution  agreement with CSKI and never undertook ? much less satisfied ? any minimum  purchase commitment. According to the SEC?s complaint, CSKI also falsely claimed in its public filings  that its top two customers for 2007 were sales agents for Takasima.? CSKI identified those customers as Ningbo  Yuehua International Trading Company and Guangzhou Xinghe International Trading  Company, which collectively accounted for the phony 25 percent of CSKI?s total  revenues for 2007.? CSKI claimed that all  of these purported sales to Ningbo Yuehua and Guangzhou Xinghe went through Takasima,  while in fact Takasima never had any relationship with these two entities.  CSKI and Liu are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the  Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rule 10b-5, and various Exchange Act provisions including corporate  reporting, recordkeeping, internal controls, and false statements to  auditors.?  The SEC?s complaint seeks financial penalties against CSKI  and Liu as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by Liu, who personally  benefited from the overstated financial statements through the company?s 2008 private placement of securities.? The SEC also seeks to have Liu reimburse CSKI  for certain incentive-based compensation he received during the period affected  by the fraud pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and to have Liu  barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company.? The SEC also seeks to have CSKI and Liu  permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions of the federal  securities laws In addition to the court action, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings to determine whether to revoke or  suspend registration of CSKI?s securities due to the company?s failure to file its  annual report for 2011 or any quarterly reports for 2012. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been  conducted by Junling Ma, Rhoda Chang, and Marshall S. Sprung of the SEC?s Los  Angeles Regional Office.?

708,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs & Co. and one of its former investment bankers with ?pay-to-play? violations involving undisclosed campaign contributions to then-Massachusetts state treasurer Timothy P. Cahill while he was a candidate for governor. Pay-to-play schemes involve campaign contributions or other payments made in an attempt to influence the awarding of lucrative public contracts for securities underwriting business. This marks the first SEC enforcement action for pay-to-play violations involving ?in-kind? non-cash contributions to a political campaign. According to the SEC?s order against Goldman Sachs, Neil M.M. Morrison was a vice president in the firm?s Boston office and solicited underwriting business from the Massachusetts treasurer?s office beginning in July 2008. Morrison also was substantially engaged in working on Cahill?s political campaigns from November 2008 to October 2010. Morrison at times conducted campaign activities from the Goldman Sachs office during work hours and using the firm?s phones and e-mail. Morrison?s use of Goldman Sachs work time and resources for campaign activities constituted valuable in-kind campaign contributions to Cahill that were attributable to Goldman Sachs and disqualified the firm from engaging in municipal underwriting business with certain Massachusetts municipal issuers for two years after the contributions. Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs subsequently participated in 30 prohibited underwritings with Massachusetts issuers and earned more than $7.5 million in underwriting fees. While the SEC?s case against Morrison continues, Goldman Sachs agreed to settle the charges by paying $7,558,942 in disgorgement, $670,033 in prejudgment interest, and a $3.75 million penalty, which is the largest ever imposed by the SEC for Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) pay-to-play violations. The SEC coordinated this enforcement action with a related action filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General against Goldman Sachs. ?The pay-to-play rules are clear: municipal finance professionals that use their firm?s resources to campaign on behalf of political candidates compromise themselves and the firms that employ them,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. Elaine C. Greenberg, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, added, ?Fighting efforts to improperly influence the underwriting selection process is one of the unit?s top priorities. These practices result in undisclosed conflicts of interest and undermine public confidence in the integrity of the municipal securities market.? According to the SEC?s orders against Morrison and Goldman Sachs, among the campaign activities that Morrison engaged in for Cahill were fundraising, drafting speeches, communicating with reporters, approving personnel decisions, and interviewing at least one possible running mate. Morrison at times referenced his campaign work while soliciting underwriting business in an apparent attempt to curry favor during the selection process. Morrison sent e-mails to a deputy treasurer in Cahill?s office making the following statements while discussing the selection of underwriters:  ?The boss [Cahill] mentioned to me this morning that he spoke to [the Assistant Treasurer] and that it is looking good for us [Goldman Sachs] on the build America bond deal.?  ?From my standpoint as an advisor/consultant/friend I am saying, PLEASE don?t give these [underwriter] slots away willy-nilly. You are in the fight of your lives and need to reward loyalty and encourage friendship. If people aren?t willing to be creative with their support then they shouldn?t expect business. This has to be a political decision.?  ?We have discussed the Build American Bond transaction and how important it is to me. You have been great keeping me up to speed. This is my number 1 priority and most important ask. Having Goldman as the lead and getting 50% of the economics would be such a home run for me.? According to the SEC?s orders, in addition to his direct campaign work for Cahill, Morrison made an indirect cash contribution to Cahill by giving cash to a friend who then wrote a check to the Cahill campaign. Morrison?s campaign work and his indirect financial contribution created a conflict of interest that was not disclosed by Goldman Sachs in the relevant municipal securities offerings in violation of pay-to-play rules. Morrison himself acknowledged the existence of this conflict in an e-mail to a campaign official, saying, ?I am staying in banking and don?t want a story that says that I am helping Cahill, who is giving me banking business. If that came out, I?m sure I wouldn?t get any more business.? According to the SEC?s orders against Goldman Sachs and Morrison, Goldman Sachs terminated Morrison in December 2010. The SEC?s order against Goldman Sachs found that the firm violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and MSRB Rule G-37(b), which prohibits firms from underwriting offerings for municipal issuers within two years after any contribution to an official of such issuer. The SEC?s order found that Goldman Sachs did not disclose any of the contributions on MSRB Forms G-37, and did not make or keep records of the contributions in violation of MSRB Rules G-37(e), G-8 and G-9. The order found that Goldman Sachs did not take steps to ensure that the attributed contributions or campaign work or the conflicts of interest raised by them were disclosed in the bond offering documents, in violation of MSRB Rule G-17, which requires broker-dealers to deal fairly and not engage in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice. The order found that Goldman Sachs failed to effectively supervise Morrison in violation of MSRB Rule G-27. Goldman Sachs consented to the SEC?s order without admitting or denying the findings. In addition to paying disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and the penalty, Goldman Sachs agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the provisions referenced in the order. In its order against Morrison, the SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that Morrison violated MSRB Rule G-37(d) by making a secret, undisclosed cash campaign contribution to Cahill, that he violated MSRB Rule G-37(c) by soliciting campaign contributions for Cahill, and that he violated MSRB Rule G-17 by failing to disclose conflicts of interest to the purchasers of municipal securities. The Division of Enforcement further alleges that Morrison caused Goldman Sachs to violate Rule G-8, Rule G-9, Rule G-37(b) and Rule G-37(e). The SEC?s investigation was conducted by members of the Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit including Senior Enforcement Counsel Louis A. Randazzo and Assistant Director LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, and supervised by Unit Chief Elaine C. Greenberg and Deputy Chief Mark Zehner. Richard Harper of the SEC?s Boston Regional Office will lead the litigation against Morrison. * * * The SEC adopted new measures in June 2010 to significantly curtail the corrupting influence of pay-to-play practices by investment advisers.",-0.10204081632653061,Negative
709,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged BP p.l.c. with misleading investors while its Deepwater Horizon oil rig was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico by significantly understating the flow rate in multiple reports filed with the SEC. The SEC alleges that the global oil and gas company headquartered in London made fraudulent public statements indicating a flow rate estimate of 5,000 barrels of oil per day. BP reported this figure despite its own internal data indicating that potential flow rates could be as high as 146,000 barrels of oil per day. BP executives also made numerous public statements after the filings were made in which they stood behind the flow rate estimate of 5,000 barrels of oil per day even though they had internal data indicating otherwise. In fact, they criticized other much higher estimates by third parties as scaremongering. Months later, a government task force determined the flow rate estimate was actually more than 10 times higher at 52,700 to 62,200 barrels of oil per day, yet BP never corrected or updated the misrepresentations and omissions it made in SEC filings for investors.  BP agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying the third-largest penalty in agency history at $525 million. The SEC plans to establish a Fair Fund with the BP penalty to provide harmed investors with compensation for losses they sustained in the fraud. The SEC announced the case today along with the Attorney General and other senior officials at the Justice Department, which brought a criminal action against BP. ""The oil spill was catastrophic for the environment, but by hiding its severity BP also harmed another constituency ? its own shareholders and the investing public who are entitled to transparency, accuracy, and completeness of company information, particularly in times of crisis,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Good corporate citizenship and responsible crisis management means that a company can't hide critical information simply because it fears the backlash.""  Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office and Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, said, ""Without accurate critical flow rate data known only to BP, the company denied its shareholders and investors the opportunity to fairly assess BP's potential liabilities and true financial condition."" According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, BP stated that the flow rate was estimated to be 5,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in three separate Forms 6-K filed with the SEC following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20, 2010. In a 6-K filed on April 29, BP stated in part, ""[e]fforts continue to stem the flow of oil from the well, currently estimated at up to 5,000 bopd[.]"" BP filed another report the next day similarly referencing ""[e]fforts to stem the flow from the well, currently estimated at up to 5,000 barrels a day are continuing[.]""  The SEC alleges that when the company made those statements, BP possessed at least five different flow rate calculations, estimates, or data indicating a much higher flow rate. BP did not possess or generate any piece of data suggesting that 5,000 bopd represented a ceiling for the rate of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico or was the best estimate. The failure to disclose the existence of these higher estimates rendered BP's statements in its Reports on Form 6-K materially false and misleading. According to the SEC's complaint, BP issued another 6-K on May 4 that stated, ""Accurate estimation of the rate of flow is difficult, but current estimates by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) suggest that some 5,000 barrels (210,000 US gallons) of oil per day are escaping from the well.""  The SEC alleges that BP omitted from its disclosure the material fact that, by this date, it possessed at least six estimates, calculations and data indicating that the oil flow rate far exceeded 5,000 bopd. Therefore, it was no longer accurate to suggest that 5,000 bopd was the best estimate or that the NOAA estimate was the current estimate. The SEC's complaint further alleges that BP executives made numerous public statements in May 2010 supporting the 5,000 bopd flow rate estimate and criticizing other estimates despite internal evidence showing that flow rates were likely well in excess of 5,000 bopd. Eventually on August 2, the Flow Rate Technical Group consisting of government and academic experts tasked with reaching a final official flow rate estimate announced that the flow rate estimate was 52,700 to 62,200 bopd. BP never corrected or updated its material misrepresentations and omissions about the flow rate.  BP has consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay the $525 million penalty and permanently restraining and enjoining the company from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-16.

711,"In coordination with the federal-state Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, the Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) with misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  The firms agreed to settlements in which they will pay more than $400 million combined, and the SEC plans to distribute the money to harmed investors. The SEC alleges that J.P. Morgan misstated information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans that provided collateral for an RMBS offering in which it was the underwriter.  J.P. Morgan received fees of more than $2.7 million, and investors sustained losses of at least $37 million on undisclosed delinquent loans.  J.P. Morgan also is charged for Bear Stearns' failure to disclose its practice of obtaining and keeping cash settlements from mortgage loan originators on problem loans that Bear Stearns had sold into RMBS trusts.  The proceeds from this bulk settlement practice were at least $137.8 million. J.P. Morgan has agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle the SEC's charges. According to the SEC's order against Credit Suisse, the firm similarly failed to accurately disclose its practice of retaining cash for itself from the settlement of claims against mortgage loan originators for problems with loans that Credit Suisse had sold into RMBS trusts and no longer owned.  Credit Suisse also made misstatements in SEC filings about when it would repurchase mortgage loans from trusts if borrowers missed the first payment due.  The firm made $55.7 million in profits and losses avoided from its bulk settlement practice, and its investors lost more than $10 million due to Credit Suisse's practices concerning first payment defaults. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay $120 million to settle the SEC's charges. ""In many ways, mortgage products such as RMBS were ground zero in the financial crisis,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.  ""Misrepresentations in connection with the creation and sale of mortgage securities contributed greatly to the tremendous losses suffered by investors once the U.S. housing market collapsed.  Today's actions involving RMBS securities are a continuation of the SEC's strong efforts to pursue wrongdoing committed in connection with the financial crisis."" Mr. Khuzami is a co-chair of the RMBS Working Group, which brings together federal and state agencies to investigate those responsible for misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis through the pooling and sale of RMBS. RMBS Working Group Co-Chair and U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado John Walsh said, ""Today's filings represent significant steps towards the accomplishment of the Working Group's mission - to investigate and confront the abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market that significantly contributed to the Financial Crisis.  The Working Group model allows the Department of Justice to lend a hand to other enforcement partners around the country who, in turn, have their own unique resources, talents, and legal tools to contribute to the effort.  And the Justice Department's efforts in this area have benefited from SEC's work on its own cases."" RMBS Working Group Co-Chair and New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said, ""Today's actions are another step forward in the process of bringing accountability for the misconduct that led to the collapse of the housing market.  We will continue to work together on behalf of consumers and investors to ensure that it never happens again."" According to the SEC's complaint against J.P. Morgan filed in federal court in Washington D.C., federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information related to assets that provide collateral for an asset-backed securities offering.  Information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans in an RMBS transaction is important to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which investors can earn interest and obtain repayment of their principal. The SEC alleges that in the prospectus supplement for the $1.8 billion RMBS offering that occurred in December 2006, J.P. Morgan made materially false and misleading statements about the loans that provided collateral for the transaction.  The firm represented that only four loans (.04 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were delinquent by 30 to 59 days, and that those four were the only loans that had had an instance of delinquency of 30 or more days in the 12 months prior to the ""cut-off date"" for the transaction.  However, at the time J.P. Morgan made these representations, the firm actually had information showing that more than 620 loans (above 7 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were, and had been, 30 to 59 days delinquent, and the four loans represented as being 30 to 59 days delinquent were in fact 60 to 89 days delinquent. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Bear Stearns' bulk settlements covered loans collateralizing 156 different RMBS transactions issued from 2005 to 2007.  Loan originators were usually required by contract to buy back loans that suffered early payment defaults or had other defects.  However, Bear Stearns frequently negotiated discounted cash settlements with these loan originators in lieu of a buy-back on loans that were owned by the RMBS trusts.  The firm - both before and after the merger with J.P. Morgan - then kept most of the bulk settlement proceeds.   The firm failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans.  Bear Stearns repurchased only about 13 percent of these defective bulk settlement loans from the trusts, compared to a nearly 100 percent repurchase rate when loan originators agreed to buy back the defective loans.  For most loans covered by bulk settlements, the firm collected money from originators without paying anything to the trusts. J.P. Morgan settled the SEC's charges by consenting to pay $50.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $24 million penalty for the delinquency misstatements, which the SEC will seek to distribute to harmed investors in the transaction through a Fair Fund.  J.P. Morgan agreed to pay $162,065,536 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $60.35 million penalty for the bulk settlement practice misconduct, and the SEC will seek to distribute these funds to harmed investors through a separate Fair Fund.  J.P. Morgan consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval. According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Credit Suisse, the firm and its affiliated entities misled investors in 75 different RMBS transactions through the bulk settlement practice.  From 2005 to 2010, Credit Suisse frequently negotiated bulk settlements with loan originators in lieu of a buy-back of loans that were owned by the RMBS trusts.  Credit Suisse kept the bulk settlement proceeds for itself and failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans.  In nine of the 75 RMBS trusts, Credit Suisse failed to comply with offering document provisions that required it to repurchase certain early defaulting loans.  Credit Suisse also applied different quality review procedures for loans that it sought to put back to originators, instituted a practice of not repurchasing such loans from trusts unless the originators had agreed to repurchase them, and failed to disclose the bulk settlement practice when answering investor questions about early payment defaults. The SEC's order also found that Credit Suisse made misleading statements about a key investor protection known as the First Payment Default (FPD) provision in two RMBS offerings.  The FPD provision required the mortgage loan originator to repurchase or substitute loans that missed payments shortly before or after they were securitized.  Credit Suisse misled investors by falsely claiming that ""all First Payment Default Risk"" was removed from its RMBS, and at the same time limiting the number of FPD loans that were put back to the originator. Credit Suisse settled the SEC's charges by consenting to pay $68,747,769 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $33 million penalty, which the SEC will seek to distribute through a Fair Fund to harmed investors in the 75 RMBS transactions affected by the bulk settlement practice.  Credit Suisse agreed to pay $12,256,561 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $6 million penalty, which the SEC will seek to distribute through a separate Fair Fund to harmed investors in the two transactions affected by the FPD misstatements.  Credit Suisse agreed to an order, without admitting or denying the allegations, requiring them to cease and desist from violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These investigations were conducted by members of the SEC Enforcement Division's Structured and New Products Unit in both the Denver and Washington, D.C. offices, including Zachary Carlyle, Mark Cave, Sarra Cho, Allison Herren Lee, Laura Metcalfe, Colin Rand, Thomas Silverstein, John Smith, Andrew Sporkin, Amy Sumner, and Jeffrey Weiss.  The trial unit members assigned to this matter were Dugan Bliss, Kyle DeYoung, Jan Folena, and Christian Schultz.  The Enforcement Division was assisted by Eugene Canjels and Vance Anthony in the Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation.  The SEC thanks the other agencies who are members of the RMBS Working Group for their assistance and cooperation regarding these enforcement actions. ""These actions demonstrate that we intend to hold accountable those who misled investors through poor disclosures in the sale of RMBS and other financial products commonly marketed and sold during the financial crisis.  Our efforts in that regard continue,"" said Kenneth Lench, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Structured and New Products Unit. * * * Today's announcement is part of the ongoing efforts of President Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) Working Group, a federal and state law enforcement effort focused on investigating fraud and abuse in the RMBS market that helped lead the 2008 financial crisis. The RMBS Working Group  brings together more than 200 attorneys, investigators, analysts and staff from dozens of state and federal agencies including the Department of Justice together with 10 U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), HUD's Office of Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Office of Inspector General, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the  Federal Reserve Board's Office of Inspector General, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and more than 10 state attorneys general offices around the country. The Working Group is led by five co-chairs: Director of Enforcement for the SEC Robert Khuzami, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division Lanny Breuer, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Division Stuart Delery and U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado John Walsh.

712,"In coordination with the federal-state Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, the Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) with misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  The firms agreed to settlements in which they will pay more than $400 million combined, and the SEC plans to distribute the money to harmed investors. The SEC alleges that J.P. Morgan misstated information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans that provided collateral for an RMBS offering in which it was the underwriter.  J.P. Morgan received fees of more than $2.7 million, and investors sustained losses of at least $37 million on undisclosed delinquent loans.  J.P. Morgan also is charged for Bear Stearns' failure to disclose its practice of obtaining and keeping cash settlements from mortgage loan originators on problem loans that Bear Stearns had sold into RMBS trusts.  The proceeds from this bulk settlement practice were at least $137.8 million. J.P. Morgan has agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle the SEC's charges. According to the SEC's order against Credit Suisse, the firm similarly failed to accurately disclose its practice of retaining cash for itself from the settlement of claims against mortgage loan originators for problems with loans that Credit Suisse had sold into RMBS trusts and no longer owned.  Credit Suisse also made misstatements in SEC filings about when it would repurchase mortgage loans from trusts if borrowers missed the first payment due.  The firm made $55.7 million in profits and losses avoided from its bulk settlement practice, and its investors lost more than $10 million due to Credit Suisse's practices concerning first payment defaults. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay $120 million to settle the SEC's charges. ""In many ways, mortgage products such as RMBS were ground zero in the financial crisis,"" said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.  ""Misrepresentations in connection with the creation and sale of mortgage securities contributed greatly to the tremendous losses suffered by investors once the U.S. housing market collapsed.  Today's actions involving RMBS securities are a continuation of the SEC's strong efforts to pursue wrongdoing committed in connection with the financial crisis."" Mr. Khuzami is a co-chair of the RMBS Working Group, which brings together federal and state agencies to investigate those responsible for misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis through the pooling and sale of RMBS. RMBS Working Group Co-Chair and U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado John Walsh said, ""Today's filings represent significant steps towards the accomplishment of the Working Group's mission - to investigate and confront the abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market that significantly contributed to the Financial Crisis.  The Working Group model allows the Department of Justice to lend a hand to other enforcement partners around the country who, in turn, have their own unique resources, talents, and legal tools to contribute to the effort.  And the Justice Department's efforts in this area have benefited from SEC's work on its own cases."" RMBS Working Group Co-Chair and New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said, ""Today's actions are another step forward in the process of bringing accountability for the misconduct that led to the collapse of the housing market.  We will continue to work together on behalf of consumers and investors to ensure that it never happens again."" According to the SEC's complaint against J.P. Morgan filed in federal court in Washington D.C., federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information related to assets that provide collateral for an asset-backed securities offering.  Information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans in an RMBS transaction is important to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which investors can earn interest and obtain repayment of their principal. The SEC alleges that in the prospectus supplement for the $1.8 billion RMBS offering that occurred in December 2006, J.P. Morgan made materially false and misleading statements about the loans that provided collateral for the transaction.  The firm represented that only four loans (.04 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were delinquent by 30 to 59 days, and that those four were the only loans that had had an instance of delinquency of 30 or more days in the 12 months prior to the ""cut-off date"" for the transaction.  However, at the time J.P. Morgan made these representations, the firm actually had information showing that more than 620 loans (above 7 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were, and had been, 30 to 59 days delinquent, and the four loans represented as being 30 to 59 days delinquent were in fact 60 to 89 days delinquent. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Bear Stearns' bulk settlements covered loans collateralizing 156 different RMBS transactions issued from 2005 to 2007.  Loan originators were usually required by contract to buy back loans that suffered early payment defaults or had other defects.  However, Bear Stearns frequently negotiated discounted cash settlements with these loan originators in lieu of a buy-back on loans that were owned by the RMBS trusts.  The firm - both before and after the merger with J.P. Morgan - then kept most of the bulk settlement proceeds.   The firm failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans.  Bear Stearns repurchased only about 13 percent of these defective bulk settlement loans from the trusts, compared to a nearly 100 percent repurchase rate when loan originators agreed to buy back the defective loans.  For most loans covered by bulk settlements, the firm collected money from originators without paying anything to the trusts. J.P. Morgan settled the SEC's charges by consenting to pay $50.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $24 million penalty for the delinquency misstatements, which the SEC will seek to distribute to harmed investors in the transaction through a Fair Fund.  J.P. Morgan agreed to pay $162,065,536 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $60.35 million penalty for the bulk settlement practice misconduct, and the SEC will seek to distribute these funds to harmed investors through a separate Fair Fund.  J.P. Morgan consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval. According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Credit Suisse, the firm and its affiliated entities misled investors in 75 different RMBS transactions through the bulk settlement practice.  From 2005 to 2010, Credit Suisse frequently negotiated bulk settlements with loan originators in lieu of a buy-back of loans that were owned by the RMBS trusts.  Credit Suisse kept the bulk settlement proceeds for itself and failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans.  In nine of the 75 RMBS trusts, Credit Suisse failed to comply with offering document provisions that required it to repurchase certain early defaulting loans.  Credit Suisse also applied different quality review procedures for loans that it sought to put back to originators, instituted a practice of not repurchasing such loans from trusts unless the originators had agreed to repurchase them, and failed to disclose the bulk settlement practice when answering investor questions about early payment defaults. The SEC's order also found that Credit Suisse made misleading statements about a key investor protection known as the First Payment Default (FPD) provision in two RMBS offerings.  The FPD provision required the mortgage loan originator to repurchase or substitute loans that missed payments shortly before or after they were securitized.  Credit Suisse misled investors by falsely claiming that ""all First Payment Default Risk"" was removed from its RMBS, and at the same time limiting the number of FPD loans that were put back to the originator. Credit Suisse settled the SEC's charges by consenting to pay $68,747,769 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $33 million penalty, which the SEC will seek to distribute through a Fair Fund to harmed investors in the 75 RMBS transactions affected by the bulk settlement practice.  Credit Suisse agreed to pay $12,256,561 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $6 million penalty, which the SEC will seek to distribute through a separate Fair Fund to harmed investors in the two transactions affected by the FPD misstatements.

713,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a purported investment adviser in New York with defrauding investors who he convinced to invest in his start-up businesses while in reality he was spending their money on illegal drugs and gambling. The SEC alleges that Stephen A. Colangelo, Jr. repeatedly misled investors while raising $3 million in investments for four start-up companies that he created.  He also persuaded three other investors to let him act as their investment adviser and they gave him more than $1 million to invest in the markets on their behalf.  Colangelo boasted a phony professional and educational background and hid his past criminal activities from potential investors, and he falsely claimed to have historically achieved extremely high returns buying and selling securities.  Meanwhile, Colangelo siphoned off at least $1 million in investor funds to pay such unauthorized personal expenses as his federal income taxes, illegal narcotics, gambling, cigars, and travel for him and his family. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Colangelo. ?Colangelo used blatantly false claims of investment success to lure investors to pour a substantial portion of their life savings into his numerous business and investment schemes,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.  ?In reality they were footing the bill for his illegal activities, luxury vacations, and even his income taxes.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Colangelo?s fraudulent scheme began in 2009 when he induced investors to invest more than $750,000 in the Brickell Fund LLC, a pooled investment vehicle that he created, advised, and controlled.  In March 2009 when the Brickell Fund did not have any investors and Colangelo was not buying and selling securities on behalf of the fund, he sent numerous e-mails to potential investors boasting phony information.  For instance, one e-mail claimed, ?BEST TRADING DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!. . . . Up over 400% and documented.  Mind boggling to say the least.?  In reality, Colangelo did not make any trades that day. The SEC alleges that after spending or losing all of the money invested in the Brickell Fund, Colangelo continued to fraudulently raise funds from investors for three other startup businesses he created ? Hedge Community LLC, Start a Hedge Fund LLC, and Under the Radar SEO LLC.  Some individuals provided Colangelo with funds directly to invest on their behalf.  Colangelo continued to use investor funds for a variety of purposes that weren?t disclosed to investors, namely personal expenses and unrelated business expenses. According to the SEC?s complaint, Colangelo created a profile on the LinkedIn website used for professional networking and misrepresented that he had studied finance at Nyack College from 1986 to 1989. Colangelo provided a link to his profile to potential and existing investors in one of his start-up companies.  His representations to investors were false because he never attended Nyack College and has not graduated from high school. The SEC?s complaint charges Colangelo with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, financial penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.   The SEC?s investigation was conducted in the New York Regional Office by Senior Attorney Christina McGill and Assistant Regional Director Wendy B. Tepperman.  The SEC?s litigation will be led by Senior Trial Counsel Kevin McGrath.

714,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three health care company employees and four others in a New Jersey-based insider trading ring of various high school friends generating $1.7 million in illegal profits and kickbacks by trading in advance of 11 public announcements involving mergers, a drug approval application, and quarterly earnings of pharmaceutical companies and medical technology firms. The SEC alleges that Celgene Corporation's director of financial reporting John Lazorchak, Sanofi S.A.'s director of accounting and reporting Mark S. Cupo, and Stryker Corporation's marketing employee Mark D. Foldy each illegally tipped confidential information about their companies for the purpose of insider trading.  Typically the nonpublic information involved upcoming mergers or acquisitions, but Lazorchak also tipped confidential details about Celgene's quarterly earnings and the status of a Celgene application to expand the use of its drug Revlimid.  The trading was carefully orchestrated so there was usually someone acting solely as a non-trading middleman who received the nonpublic information from the insider and tipped others.  They hoped to avoid detection with no direct connection between the insiders and the traders, and the insiders were later compensated for the inside information with cash payments made in installments to avoid any scrutiny of large cash withdrawals. The SEC alleges that Cupo's friend Michael Castelli along with Lawrence Grum, who attended high school with Castelli, were the primary traders in the scheme.  Among the ways that Castelli and Grum tried to hide their illegal conduct was by compiling binders of research to serve as a false basis for their trading.  They actively traded in Celgene securities to create a pattern of long-standing positions in the stock.  Grum reassured Cupo that discovery of the scheme and consequent legal action was unlikely due to limited government resources to police insider trading activity.  Grum said, ""At the end of the day, the SEC's got to pick their battle because they have a limited number of people and a huge number of investors to go after.""  Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and Director of the Philadelphia Regional Office, said, ""This is yet another case where wrongdoers believed they could outsmart investigators by creating an elaborate smokescreen to hide their insider trading.  Such tactics as using middlemen to pass inside information and compiling research to falsely justify illegal trades will not prevent lawbreakers from getting caught."" The other two traders charged are Lazorchak's high school friends Michael T. Pendolino and James N. Deprado, who now live in New Hampshire and Virginia respectively.  The others live in New Jersey.  In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Lazorchak, Cupo, Foldy, Castelli, Grum, and Pendolino.   According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the scheme began in late 2007 when Lazorchak and Cupo, who were friends and colleagues at Sanofi, discussed Lazorchak's new position at Celgene where he'd have access to nonpublic information about mergers and acquisitions.  Lazorchak told Cupo that he was initially working on Celgene's possible acquisition of another pharmaceutical company, Pharmion.  Cupo discussed Lazorchak's position with Castelli, a friend with whom he attends winemaking club meetings.  Castelli brought in Grum, who he considered a sophisticated trader with knowledge of the securities industry.  Castelli and Grum devised the scheme in which Lazorchak tipped Cupo with nonpublic Celgene-related information.  Cupo, as the middleman, tipped Castelli and Grum so they could illegally trade.  Castelli and Grum paid Cupo for his tips, and gave Cupo money to pass along to Lazorchak for the initial tips.  Lazorchak never knew the identities of Castelli or Grum, but was aware that Cupo was passing confidential Celgene information to other traders. The SEC alleges that Lazorchak's high school friend Foldy entered the scheme in 2007, when Lazorchak tipped him with confidential details about the impending merger between Celgene and Pharmion, and Foldy illegally traded on the information prior to the public announcement of the deal.  Lazorchak and Foldy devised and used code phrases while conversing to identify instances when Lazorchak was passing inside information or Foldy was seeking more details.  After the illegal trading occurred and Foldy obtained illicit profits of $14,500, Lazorchak repeatedly demanded that Foldy compensate him for the inside information.  Foldy ultimately paid Lazorchak at least $500 and later returned the favor with illegal tips of confidential information about a tender offer involving his employer, Stryker Corp.  Lazorchak acted as a middleman and did not trade, instead tipping Pendolino so he could trade on the nonpublic information.  Pendolino in turn tipped Deprado, who also traded.  Lazorchak additionally tipped Cupo, who did not trade but acted as a middleman and tipped Castelli and Grum, who both traded.  The SEC alleges that Cupo began tipping inside information about his employer in late 2009, when he learned that Sanofi was planning to announce a tender offer to acquire another pharmaceutical company, Chattem Inc.  Cupo learned of the imminent tender offer a few days prior to the public announcement, he tipped Castelli and Grum with the confidential details, and they both traded on the nonpublic information. The SEC alleges that each of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and that Castelli and Grum violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and officer and director bars for Lazorchak, Cupo, and Foldy.

The SEC alleges that Lazorchak's high school friend Foldy entered the scheme in 2007, when Lazorchak tipped him with confidential details about the impending merger between Celgene and Pharmion, and Foldy illegally traded on the information prior to the public announcement of the deal.  Lazorchak and Foldy devised and used code phrases while conversing to identify instances when Lazorchak was passing inside information or Foldy was seeking more details.  After the illegal trading occurred and Foldy obtained illicit profits of $14,500, Lazorchak repeatedly demanded that Foldy compensate him for the inside information.  Foldy ultimately paid Lazorchak at least $500 and later returned the favor with illegal tips of confidential information about a tender offer involving his employer, Stryker Corp.  Lazorchak acted as a middleman and did not trade, instead tipping Pendolino so he could trade on the nonpublic information.  Pendolino in turn tipped Deprado, who also traded.  Lazorchak additionally tipped Cupo, who did not trade but acted as a middleman and tipped Castelli and Grum, who both traded.  The SEC alleges that Cupo began tipping inside information about his employer in late 2009, when he learned that Sanofi was planning to announce a tender offer to acquire another pharmaceutical company, Chattem Inc.  Cupo learned of the imminent tender offer a few days prior to the public announcement, he tipped Castelli and Grum with the confidential details, and they both traded on the nonpublic information. The SEC alleges that each of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and that Castelli and Grum violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and officer and director bars for Lazorchak, Cupo, and Foldy.

717,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three health care company employees and four others in a New Jersey-based insider trading ring of various high school friends generating $1.7 million in illegal profits and kickbacks by trading in advance of 11 public announcements involving mergers, a drug approval application, and quarterly earnings of pharmaceutical companies and medical technology firms. The SEC alleges that Celgene Corporation's director of financial reporting John Lazorchak, Sanofi S.A.'s director of accounting and reporting Mark S. Cupo, and Stryker Corporation's marketing employee Mark D. Foldy each illegally tipped confidential information about their companies for the purpose of insider trading.  Typically the nonpublic information involved upcoming mergers or acquisitions, but Lazorchak also tipped confidential details about Celgene's quarterly earnings and the status of a Celgene application to expand the use of its drug Revlimid.  The trading was carefully orchestrated so there was usually someone acting solely as a non-trading middleman who received the nonpublic information from the insider and tipped others.  They hoped to avoid detection with no direct connection between the insiders and the traders, and the insiders were later compensated for the inside information with cash payments made in installments to avoid any scrutiny of large cash withdrawals. The SEC alleges that Cupo's friend Michael Castelli along with Lawrence Grum, who attended high school with Castelli, were the primary traders in the scheme.  Among the ways that Castelli and Grum tried to hide their illegal conduct was by compiling binders of research to serve as a false basis for their trading.  They actively traded in Celgene securities to create a pattern of long-standing positions in the stock.  Grum reassured Cupo that discovery of the scheme and consequent legal action was unlikely due to limited government resources to police insider trading activity.  Grum said, ""At the end of the day, the SEC's got to pick their battle because they have a limited number of people and a huge number of investors to go after.""  Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and Director of the Philadelphia Regional Office, said, ""This is yet another case where wrongdoers believed they could outsmart investigators by creating an elaborate smokescreen to hide their insider trading.  Such tactics as using middlemen to pass inside information and compiling research to falsely justify illegal trades will not prevent lawbreakers from getting caught."" The other two traders charged are Lazorchak's high school friends Michael T. Pendolino and James N. Deprado, who now live in New Hampshire and Virginia respectively.  The others live in New Jersey.  In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Lazorchak, Cupo, Foldy, Castelli, Grum, and Pendolino.   According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the scheme began in late 2007 when Lazorchak and Cupo, who were friends and colleagues at Sanofi, discussed Lazorchak's new position at Celgene where he'd have access to nonpublic information about mergers and acquisitions.  Lazorchak told Cupo that he was initially working on Celgene's possible acquisition of another pharmaceutical company, Pharmion.  Cupo discussed Lazorchak's position with Castelli, a friend with whom he attends winemaking club meetings.  Castelli brought in Grum, who he considered a sophisticated trader with knowledge of the securities industry.  Castelli and Grum devised the scheme in which Lazorchak tipped Cupo with nonpublic Celgene-related information.  Cupo, as the middleman, tipped Castelli and Grum so they could illegally trade.  Castelli and Grum paid Cupo for his tips, and gave Cupo money to pass along to Lazorchak for the initial tips.  Lazorchak never knew the identities of Castelli or Grum, but was aware that Cupo was passing confidential Celgene information to other traders. The SEC alleges that Lazorchak's high school friend Foldy entered the scheme in 2007, when Lazorchak tipped him with confidential details about the impending merger between Celgene and Pharmion, and Foldy illegally traded on the information prior to the public announcement of the deal.

718,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Stamford, Conn.-based hedge fund advisory firm CR Intrinsic Investors LLC and its former portfolio manager along with a medical consultant for an expert network firm for their roles in a $276 million insider trading scheme involving a clinical trial for an Alzheimer?s drug being jointly developed by two pharmaceutical companies.  The illicit gains generated in this scheme make it the largest insider trading case ever charged by the SEC. The SEC alleges that Mathew Martoma illegally obtained confidential details about the clinical trial from Dr. Sidney Gilman, who served as chairman of the safety monitoring committee overseeing the trial.  Dr. Gilman was selected by Elan Corporation and Wyeth to present the final drug trial results to the public.  In phone calls that were arranged by a New York-based expert network firm for which he moonlighted as a medical consultant, Dr. Gilman tipped Martoma with safety data and eventually details about negative results in the trial about two weeks before they were made public in July 2008.  Martoma then caused several hedge funds to sell more than $960 million in Elan and Wyeth securities in just over a week. Dr. Gilman, who lives in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he works as a medical school professor, has agreed to settle the SEC?s charges and cooperate in this action and related SEC investigations.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Martoma and a non-prosecution agreement with Dr. Gilman. Martoma lives in Boca Raton, Fla. ?Today?s record-setting insider trading case reinforces the cold, hard lesson of so many other recent cases that when you trade on inside information, you?re not just betting your money but also your career, your reputation, your financial security, and your liberty,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Now, yet another corrupt hedge fund manager has learned the high cost of ignoring that lesson.? Sanjay Wadhwa, Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office and Deputy Chief of the Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit, added, ?Today?s action against CR Intrinsic underscores our commitment to hold hedge fund advisory firms accountable when their employees break the law for the firms? benefit.  The clear message is that firms should adopt appropriate procedural safeguards and a culture of zero tolerance toward employee misconduct that could subject the firm to such serious consequences.?  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Martoma first met Dr. Gilman through paid consultations arranged by the expert network firm.  Dr. Gilman provided Martoma with material nonpublic information concerning the Phase II trial of the potential Alzheimer?s drug called bapineuzumab (bapi).  They coordinated their expert network consultations around scheduled safety monitoring committee meetings, and during their phone calls they discussed PowerPoint presentations made during the meetings and Dr. Gilman provided Martoma with his perspective on the results.  Dr. Gilman developed a personal relationship with Martoma, eventually coming to view Martoma as a friend and pupil.   The SEC alleges that Martoma caused hedge funds managed by CR Intrinsic as well as hedge funds managed by an affiliated investment adviser to trade on the negative inside information he received from Dr. Gilman.  Although Elan and Wyeth?s shares rose on June 17, 2008, on the public release of top-line results of the Phase II trial, market participants were disappointed by the detailed final results issued on July 29, 2008.  Double-digit declines in Elan and Wyeth shares ensued.  After Martoma was tipped, the hedge funds not only liquidated their combined long position in Elan and Wyeth of more than $700 million, but went on to hold substantial short positions in both securities.  This massive repositioning allowed CR Intrinsic and the affiliated advisory firm to reap approximately $82 million in profits and $194 million in avoided losses for a total of more than $276 million in illicit gains.  According to the SEC?s complaint, Martoma received a $9.3 million bonus at the end of 2008 ? a significant portion of which was attributable to the illegal profits that the hedge funds managed by CR Intrinsic and the other investment advisory firm had generated in this scheme.  Dr. Gilman, who was generally paid $1,000 per hour as a consultant for the expert network firm, received more than $100,000 for his consultations with Martoma and others at the hedge fund advisory firms.  Dr. Gilman also received approximately $79,000 from Elan for his consultations concerning bapi in 2007 and 2008. The SEC?s complaint charges each of the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.   Dr. Gilman has agreed to pay more than $234,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  He also agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the court, which also will determine at a later date whether any additional financial penalty is appropriate.

According to the SEC?s complaint, the insider trading occurred in advance of Delta Petroleum Corporation?s public announcement that Beverly Hills-based private investment firm Tracinda had agreed to purchase a 35 percent stake in the company, which shot its stock value up by nearly 20 percent. The SEC initially charged insurance executive Michael Van Gilder for his illegal trading in the case, and is now additionally charging his source: Delta?s then-CEO Roger Parker. The SEC?s amended complaint alleges that Parker, who lives in Englewood, Colo., illegally tipped his close friend Van Gilder and at least one other friend with confidential information about Tracinda?s impending investment. Despite his duty as CEO to protect nonpublic information, Parker repeatedly communicated with Van Gilder following meetings and other developments as the deal progressed. Parker also illegally tipped information about Delta?s quarterly earnings.

723,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two retail brokers who formerly worked at a Connecticut-based broker-dealer with insider trading on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation?s acquisition of SPSS Inc.   The SEC alleges that Thomas C. Conradt learned confidential details about the merger from his roommate, a research analyst who got the information from an attorney working on the transaction who discussed it in confidence.  Conradt purchased SPSS securities and subsequently tipped his friend and fellow broker David J. Weishaus, who also traded.  The insider trading yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  The SEC?s investigation uncovered instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus where they openly discussed their illegal activity.  The SEC?s investigation is continuing. ?When licensed professionals who are privileged to work in the securities industry violate legal duties and enrich themselves at investors? expense, it undermines public confidence in the integrity of the markets,? said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC?s Philadelphia Regional Office.  ?As industry professionals, Conradt and Weishaus clearly understood that what they were doing was wrong, but did so anyway while knowing the consequences they would face if caught.? In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Conradt and Weishaus, who live in Denver and Baltimore respectively. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the scheme occurred in 2009.  Conradt revealed in instant messages that he received the information from the research analyst and warned Weishaus that they needed to ?keep this in the family.?  Weishaus agreed, typing ?i don't want to go to jail.?  They went on to discuss other people who have been prosecuted for insider trading.  In another series of instant messages, Conradt bragged that he was ?makin everyone rich? by sharing the nonpublic information.  Weishaus later noted, ?this is gonna be sweet.? The SEC alleges that the research analyst?s attorney friend sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told the research analyst about his new assignment at work on the SPSS acquisition by IBM.  In describing the magnitude of the assignment, the lawyer disclosed material, nonpublic information about the proposed transaction, including the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies.  The associate expected the research analyst to maintain this information in confidence and refrain from trading on this information or disclosing it to others.   The SEC alleges that Conradt, Weishaus, and other downstream tippees purchased common stock and call options in SPSS.  A call option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock of the issuer and gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specified period of time.  Typically, investors will purchase call options when they believe the stock of the underlying securities is going up.  Conradt, Weishaus, and other downstream tippees invested so heavily in SPSS securities that the investments accounted for 76 percent to 100 percent of their various brokerage accounts.  Conradt and Weishaus both hold law degrees.  Conradt is admitted to practice law in Maryland, and he passed the Colorado bar examination administered in February 2012.

725,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut-based business executive with insider trading ahead of the sale of Patriot Capital Funding Group based on nonpublic information he learned at the helm of a firm involved in the bidding process. The SEC alleges that I. Joseph Massoud, who founded investment advisory firm Compass Group Management, gained access to nonpublic information contained in an online ?dataroom? where bidding companies could learn more about Patriot Capital?s financial condition.  For access to the data, Compass Group had to enter into a confidentiality agreement that prohibited its employees from buying Patriot Capital stock.  Nonetheless, Massoud purchased shares soon after Compass Group gained access to the confidential information, and he bought even more stock after he learned that Compass Group?s bid was what he described as ?waaaaay off? compared to bids from other companies.  Patriot Capital?s share price more than doubled after a merger was publicly announced, and Massoud realized more than $676,000 in illegal profits.  Massoud, who lives in Westport, Conn., agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying more than $1.4 million.  He also will be barred from working in the securities industry or serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The settlement is subject to court approval. ?With full knowledge of a confidentiality agreement that prohibited him from buying Patriot Capital stock, Massoud abused his access to nonpublic data for what turned out to be a short-term personal gain,? said John T. Dugan, Associate Director of the SEC?s Boston Regional Office.  ?As a result of the SEC?s action, Massoud must pay back double what he made in the scheme and he can never work in the securities industry again.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut, Patriot Capital initiated a nonpublic bidding process in 2009 to entertain proposals for strategic investments and the possible sale of the company.  In May 2009, Massoud directed Compass Group to execute a confidentiality agreement with Patriot Capital so it could participate in that process.  After Compass Group was provided access to the online dataroom as part of the bidding process, a Compass Group analyst accessed the dataroom and provided various reports containing material, nonpublic information to Massoud.   The SEC alleges that Massoud also learned nonpublic information about the value of bids received by Patriot Capital from other parties involved in the bidding process.  On July 7, 2009, Massoud e-mailed others working on the Patriot Capital transaction at Compass Group and indicated that he had just talked with Patriot Capital?s CEO.  He wrote that Compass Group was ?waaaaay off? on its bid to acquire Patriot Capital, which according to the CEO had received several acquisition bids that were much higher than Compass Group?s offer.  Massoud also learned from the CEO that Compass Group would have to increase its bid to match those higher proposals if it wanted to be considered. According to the SEC?s complaint, Massoud bought 322,216 shares of Patriot Capital stock in transactions spread across 15 different trading days from May to July.  Massoud purchased more than half of those shares after July 7 when Patriot Capital?s CEO confidentially told him about other higher bids to acquire Patriot Capital.  On Aug. 3, 2009, Patriot Capital publicly announced a merger with Prospect Capital Corporation.  On August 25, after Patriot Capital had been acquired and its stock price had increased significantly, Massoud sold all of his Patriot Capital stock.   The SEC alleges that Massoud violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and that his profits constitute ill-gotten gains.  Massoud agreed to pay disgorgement of $676,013, prejudgment interest of $80,785, and a penalty of $676,013.  He agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the future, and he will be barred from serving as a public company officer or director and from being associated with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal adviser, transfer agent, or national recognized statistical rating organization.

The SEC alleges that John W. Femenia misused his position at Wells Fargo Securities to obtain material, nonpublic information about four separate merger transactions involving firm clients.  Upon learning inside information about an impending deal, Femenia?s first call to set the insider trading ring in motion was typically to his longtime friend Shawn C. Hegedus, who worked as a registered broker.  Femenia and Hegedus illegally tipped other friends who in turn tipped more friends or family members in a ring that spread across five states.   The SEC has obtained a court order freezing the assets of the illegal traders. ?Here you have an investment banker who clearly knew better that inside information can?t form the basis of trading decisions,? said William P. Hicks, Associate Director for Enforcement in the SEC?s Atlanta Regional Office.  ?Instead he basically started a phone tree of nonpublic information to enrich friends and others.?  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Femenia was based in Wells Fargo?s Charlotte office when most of the misconduct occurred, but later moved and worked in New York where he currently resides.  Femenia?s tippees included his friends Aaron M. Wens, who lives in Encinatas, Calif., and Matthew Musante, who lives in Miami.  Musante tipped his father Anthony Musante, who lives in Melbourne, Fla.  Hegedus tipped his girlfriend Danielle Laurenti and his business colleague Roger A. Williams, who lives in Georgetown, S.C.  Williams tipped three of his friends: Frank M. Burgess, Jr. of Charlotte, James A. Hayes IV of Charlotte, and Kenneth M. Raby of Greer, S.C. The SEC charged two companies with ties to Hegedus or Laurenti that were involved in the illegal trading: Coram Real Estate Holdings Inc. and GoldStar P.S.  The SEC also charged two others as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering illicit profits that are now in their possession: Femenia?s girlfriend Kristine Lack and Anthony Musante?s wife Christine Musante.  According to the SEC?s complaint, the illegal trading occurred from July 2010 to July 2012 and involved the following transactions: The acquisition of ATC Technology Corporation by GENCO Distribution Systems (publicly announced July 19, 2010)? The acquisition of Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. by Rock-Tenn Company (publicly announced Jan. 23, 2011)? The acquisition of K-Sea Transportation Partners by Kirby Corporation (publicly announced March 13, 2011)? The acquisition of The Shaw Group by Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. (publicly announced July 30, 2012)  According to the SEC?s complaint, Femenia?s tips enabled profitable trades in the stock and options of the companies being acquired in the deals, and at least one trader provided a portion of his profits to Femenia in exchange for the information.

730,"The Securities and  Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based fund manager with conducting  a pair of illegal trading schemes to financially benefit his investment fund  Octagon Capital Partners LP. The SEC alleges that Steven B. Hart made $831,071 during a  four-year period through illicit trading while he also worked as a portfolio  manager and employee at a New Jersey-based firm that served as an adviser for  several affiliated investment funds.? In one  scheme, Hart illegally matched 31 pre-market trades to benefit his own fund at  the expense of one of his employer?s funds.?  In the other scheme, Hart conducted insider trading in the securities of  19 issuers based on nonpublic information he learned in advance of their  offering announcements. Furthermore, Hart signed two securities purchase agreements in which he falsely represented that he had not traded the issuer's securities prior to the public announcement of the offerings in which he had been confidentially solicited to invest. Hart agreed to pay more than $1.3 million to settle the  SEC?s charges. ?By engaging in more than 50 instances of illegal activity  in his securities trading, Hart showed a complete disregard for the securities  laws and our markets,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York  Regional Office. ??Hart also misused his  position of authority as a portfolio manager of his employer?s fund in order to  make handsome profits for his own fund.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of New York, Hart conducted his schemes from  2007 to 2011.? He caused Octagon to  purchase stock in small, thinly traded issuers at the going market price so  that he could sell the same stock the following day to his employer?s fund at a  price substantially above the prevailing market price.? Each of the sales from Octagon to the  employer?s fund occurred in pre-market trading, thus Hart was able to ensure  that the trades matched.? Later that same  day or within a few days of the matched trades, Hart directed the employer?s  fund to sell the recently-acquired stock on the open market at a loss.? Hart generated ill-gotten gains of $586,338  for Octagon in this scheme. According to the SEC?s complaint, Hart was confidentially  solicited by 19 issuers to invest in securities offerings where he expressly  agreed to go ?over-the-wall? and keep confidential the information he received  and not trade on it.? Nevertheless, Hart  traded for Octagon on the basis of material nonpublic information about the  offerings in breach of his duty of trust or confidence.? Hart?s illegal trades involved PIPE offerings,  registered direct offerings, and confidentially marketed public offerings.? Octagon derived ill-gotten gains of $244,733  as a result of Hart?s misconduct. The SEC alleges that in order to induce two issuers to sell  securities to his fund, Hart signed securities purchase agreements falsely  representing that Octagon had not traded the issuers? securities after he had  been solicited.? Despite going  ?over-the-wall? during the solicitations conducted by the two issuers, Hart  directed short sales of these issuers? securities and obtained insider trading  profits.? He subsequently signed the  securities purchase agreements misrepresenting that he hadn?t traded in their  securities in the days leading up to the public announcements about the  offerings.?  The SEC?s complaint against Hart alleges violations of  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940.? Hart agreed to pay  $831,071 in disgorgement, $103,424 in prejudgment interest, and a $394,733  penalty to settle the SEC?s charges without admitting or denying the  allegations.? Hart also consented to the  entry of a judgment enjoining him from future violations of the respective  provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Advisers Act.?

Furthermore, Hart signed two securities purchase agreements in which he falsely represented that he had not traded the issuer's securities prior to the public announcement of the offerings in which he had been confidentially solicited to invest. Hart agreed to pay more than $1.3 million to settle the  SEC?s charges. ?By engaging in more than 50 instances of illegal activity  in his securities trading, Hart showed a complete disregard for the securities  laws and our markets,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York  Regional Office. ??Hart also misused his  position of authority as a portfolio manager of his employer?s fund in order to  make handsome profits for his own fund.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of New York, Hart conducted his schemes from  2007 to 2011.? He caused Octagon to  purchase stock in small, thinly traded issuers at the going market price so  that he could sell the same stock the following day to his employer?s fund at a  price substantially above the prevailing market price.? Each of the sales from Octagon to the  employer?s fund occurred in pre-market trading, thus Hart was able to ensure  that the trades matched.? Later that same  day or within a few days of the matched trades, Hart directed the employer?s  fund to sell the recently-acquired stock on the open market at a loss.? Hart generated ill-gotten gains of $586,338  for Octagon in this scheme. According to the SEC?s complaint, Hart was confidentially  solicited by 19 issuers to invest in securities offerings where he expressly  agreed to go ?over-the-wall? and keep confidential the information he received  and not trade on it.? Nevertheless, Hart  traded for Octagon on the basis of material nonpublic information about the  offerings in breach of his duty of trust or confidence.? Hart?s illegal trades involved PIPE offerings,  registered direct offerings, and confidentially marketed public offerings.? Octagon derived ill-gotten gains of $244,733  as a result of Hart?s misconduct. The SEC alleges that in order to induce two issuers to sell  securities to his fund, Hart signed securities purchase agreements falsely  representing that Octagon had not traded the issuers? securities after he had  been solicited.? Despite going  ?over-the-wall? during the solicitations conducted by the two issuers, Hart  directed short sales of these issuers? securities and obtained insider trading  profits.? He subsequently signed the  securities purchase agreements misrepresenting that he hadn?t traded in their  securities in the days leading up to the public announcements about the  offerings.?  The SEC?s complaint against Hart alleges violations of  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940.? Hart agreed to pay  $831,071 in disgorgement, $103,424 in prejudgment interest, and a $394,733  penalty to settle the SEC?s charges without admitting or denying the  allegations.? Hart also consented to the  entry of a judgment enjoining him from future violations of the respective  provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Advisers Act.?

732,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Toronto-based brokerage firm and its top two executives for failing to supervise overseas day traders who used the firm?s order management system to engage repeatedly in a manipulative trading practice known as layering. In layering, a trader places orders with no intention of having them executed but rather to trick others into buying or selling a stock at an artificial price driven by the orders, which the trader later cancels. The SEC?s investigation found that Biremis ? whose worldwide day trading business enabled up to 5,000 traders on as many 200 trading floors in 30 countries to gain access to U.S. markets ? failed to address repeated instances of layering by many of the overseas day traders using its system. The firm?s co-founders Peter Beck and Charles Kim ignored repeated red flags indicating that overseas traders were engaging in layering manipulations. Biremis served as the broker-dealer for an affiliated Canadian day trading firm, Swift Trade Inc. Biremis and the two executives agreed to a settlement in which the firm?s registration as a U.S. broker-dealer is revoked and permanent industry bars are imposed on Beck and Kim, who also will pay a combined half-million dollars to settle the SEC?s charges. ?Engaged and forceful supervisors are the first line of defense against individual misconduct in financial services companies,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Beck and Kim were neither, as they saw obvious red flags of market manipulation by their firm?s traders but failed to respond or take any steps to prevent the manipulation. They have learned the painful lesson that supervisors who fail to heed repeated red flags of misconduct will no longer have any place in the securities industry.? According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Biremis, Beck, and Kim exercised substantial control over the overseas day traders. They backed the traders? trading with capital from Biremis, determined the amount of Biremis capital available to each individual trader to purchase stocks, and set and enforced daily loss limits on each trader. They also wielded authority to reprimand, restrict, suspend, or terminate traders. The SEC?s order found that many of the Biremis-affiliated overseas day traders engaged in repeated instances of layering from January 2007 to mid-2010. Beck and Kim learned from numerous sources ? including three U.S. broker-dealers and a Biremis employee ? that layering was occurring, yet they failed to take any steps to prevent it. For example, in spring 2008, representatives of one U.S. broker-dealer warned Beck and Kim that certain overseas traders were ?gaming? U.S. stocks by altering those stocks? bid and offer prices in order to buy or sell the stock at the altered price. Beck and Kim failed to act on this information. According to the SEC?s order, Biremis also failed to retain virtually all of its instant messages related to its broker-dealer business, and failed to file any suspicious activity reports (SARs) related to the manipulative trading.  ?Broker-dealers must recognize that their supervisory responsibilities over their associated persons don?t end at the U.S. border,? said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?Broker-dealers face severe consequences if they fail to supervise their traders who engage in manipulative trading, whether those traders are located in the U.S. or abroad.? The SEC?s order finds that Biremis, Beck, and Kim failed reasonably to supervise the firm?s associated persons (the overseas day traders) with a view to preventing and detecting their layering manipulations. The order also finds that Biremis willfully violated Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-8 by failing to file SARs and Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) by failing to retain instant messages.  The SEC?s order revokes Biremis? registration as a broker-dealer and requires the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rules 17a-4(b)(4) and 17a-8. The SEC imposed permanent industry bars on Beck and Kim, who each agreed to pay penalties of $250,000. Biremis, Beck, and Kim neither admitted nor denied the findings contained in the SEC?s order.

733,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Eli Lilly and Company with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for improper payments its subsidiaries made to foreign government officials to win millions of dollars of business in Russia, Brazil, China, and Poland. The SEC alleges that the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company?s subsidiary in Russia used offshore ?marketing agreements? to pay millions of dollars to third parties chosen by government customers or distributors, despite knowing little or nothing about the third parties beyond their offshore address and bank account information.  These offshore entities rarely provided any services and in some instances were used to funnel money to government officials in order to obtain business for the subsidiary.  Transactions with offshore or government-affiliated entities did not receive specialized or closer review for possible FCPA violations.  Paperwork was accepted at face value and little was done to assess whether the terms or circumstances surrounding a transaction suggested the possibility of foreign bribery.   The SEC alleges that when the company did become aware of possible FCPA violations in Russia, Lilly did not curtail the subsidiary?s use of the marketing agreements for more than five years.  Lilly subsidiaries in Brazil, China, and Poland also made improper payments to government officials or third-party entities associated with government officials.  Lilly agreed to pay more than $29 million to settle the SEC?s charges. ?When a parent company learns tell-tale signs of a bribery scheme involving a subsidiary, it must take immediate action to assure that the FCPA is not being violated,? said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SEC Enforcement Division.  ?We strongly caution company officials from averting their eyes from what they do not wish to see.? Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Foreign Corrupt Practices Unit, added, ?Eli Lilly and its subsidiaries possessed a ?check the box? mentality when it came to third-party due diligence.  Companies can?t simply rely on paper-thin assurances by employees, distributors, or customers.  They need to look at the surrounding circumstances of any payment to adequately assess whether it could wind up in a government official?s pocket.? As alleged in the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C.:  Lilly?s subsidiary in Russia paid millions of dollars to offshore entities for alleged ?marketing services? in order to induce pharmaceutical distributors and government entities to purchase Lilly?s drugs, including approximately $2 million to an offshore entity owned by a government official and approximately $5.2 million to offshore entities owned by a person closely associated with an important member of Russia?s parliament.  Despite the company?s recognition that the marketing agreements were being used to ?create sales potential? with government customers and that it did not appear that any actual services were being rendered under the agreements, Eli Lilly allowed its subsidiary to continue using the agreements for years.? Employees at Lilly?s subsidiary in China falsified expense reports in order to provide spa treatments, jewelry, and other improper gifts and cash payments to government-employed physicians.? Lilly?s subsidiary in Brazil allowed one of its pharmaceutical distributors to pay bribes to government health officials to facilitate $1.2 million in sales of a Lilly drug product to state government institutions.? Lilly?s subsidiary in Poland made eight improper payments totaling $39,000 to a small charitable foundation that was founded and administered by the head of one of the regional government health authorities in exchange for the official?s support for placing Lilly drugs on the government reimbursement list.  Lilly agreed to pay disgorgement of $13,955,196, prejudgment interest of $6,743,538, and a penalty of $8.7 million for a total payment of $29,398,734.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lilly consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  Lilly also agreed to comply with certain undertakings including the retention of an independent consultant to review and make recommendations about its foreign corruption policies and procedures.

734,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced additional charges in an insider trading case against two brokers who traded on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation?s acquisition of SPSS Inc.   In an amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC is now charging research analyst Trent Martin, who was the brokers? source of confidential information in an insider trading scheme that yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  Martin worked at a brokerage firm in Connecticut and specialized in Australian equity investments, and he learned nonpublic information about the impending IBM-SPSS transaction from an attorney friend who was working on the deal.  Rather than maintaining the confidence of the information, Martin used the information for his own benefit, purchasing SPSS securities and subsequently tipping his roommate Thomas C. Conradt, who traded and tipped his friend and fellow retail broker David J. Weishaus.  Martin was specifically named as their source in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus about their illegal trading. The SEC charged Conradt and Weishaus with insider trading on November 29.  Martin, who fled the U.S. to Australia soon after learning about the SEC?s investigation, currently lives in Hong Kong.  ?Martin is a licensed professional who knowingly disregarded insider trading laws to enrich himself, and then fled the United States when he learned of our investigation,? said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC?s Philadelphia Regional Office.  ?Martin could run but he could not hide, as the long arm of the SEC will extend to those who flee the United States hoping to avoid the consequences of their unlawful conduct.? The SEC alleges that Martin?s attorney friend expected him to maintain information in confidence and refrain from illegal trading or disclosing it to others.  The attorney sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told Martin about his new assignment working on the IBM-SPSS acquisition.  The lawyer disclosed to Martin such details as the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies while he was describing the magnitude of the assignment.  According to the SEC?s complaint, Martin attempted to purchase SPSS common stock on the very first business day after learning the nonpublic information from his friend.  His first three orders were cancelled because he did not have sufficient funds in the account to make the purchases, but he later wired $50,000 from his checking account into his brokerage account to purchase SPSS shares. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Martin, Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers.

735,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former executives at Norfolk, Va.-based Bank of the Commonwealth for understating millions of dollars in losses and masking the true health of the bank?s loan portfolio at the height of the financial crisis. The SEC alleges that Edward J. Woodard, who was CEO, president, and chairman of the board, was responsible along with CFO Cynthia A. Sabol and executive vice president Stephen G. Fields for misrepresentations to investors by the bank?s parent company Commonwealth Bankshares. The consistent message in Commonwealth?s public statements and SEC filings was that its portfolio of loans ? which comprised approximately 94 percent of the company?s total assets in 2008 ? was conservatively managed according to strict underwriting standards aimed at keeping the bank?s reserved losses low during a time of unprecedented economic turmoil.   In reality, the SEC alleges that internal practice deviated significantly from what the public was being told.  Woodard knew the true state of Commonwealth?s rapidly-deteriorating loan portfolio, yet he worked to hide the problems and engineer the misleading public statements, particularly those made in earnings releases.  Sabol knew of the activity to mask the problems with the company?s loan portfolio and the corresponding effect these masking practices had on the bank?s financial statements and disclosures, yet she signed the disclosures and certified to the investing public that they were accurate.  Fields oversaw the bank?s largest portfolio of construction and development loans and was involved in the masking practices.   ?During times of financial stress, it?s more important than ever for executives to make full and honest disclosure to the investing public,? said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?Commonwealth?s executives did the opposite and hid the company?s worsening performance from shareholders through masking practices that understated the losses on its most troubled loans.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Commonwealth understated its allowance for loan and lease losses (known as ALLL) by approximately 17 to 25 percent from November 2008 to August 2010.  This caused the bank to understate its reported loss before income taxes by approximately 64 percent for fiscal year 2008.  Commonwealth also understated its losses on real estate repossessed by the bank (known as OREO) in two fiscal quarters, which caused the bank to understate its reported loss before income. For eight consecutive fiscal quarters, Commonwealth underreported its total non-performing loans. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Commonwealth obtained an appraisal for its largest collateral-dependent loan that falsely inflated the value of the collateral.  The bank executed hundreds of ?change-in-terms agreements? at the end of the quarter to remove tens of millions of dollars of loans from its reported non-performing loans.  Woodard, Sabol, and Fields helped enable the bank to artificially bring otherwise-delinquent loans current by permitting checking accounts associated with the guarantors of the delinquent loans to be overdrawn.  The bank also disbursed loan proceeds without inspecting the property to confirm that the work requiring the disbursement had actually been performed. The SEC?s complaint charges Woodard, Sabol, and Fields with violations of the antifraud, reporting, recordkeeping, internal controls, deceit of auditors, and Sarbanes-Oxley certification provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Laura B. Josephs, Thomas D. Silverstein, David S. Karp, Lucas R. Moskowitz, and David Estabrook.

736,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two auditors at KPMG for their roles in a failed audit of a Nebraska-based bank that hid millions of dollars in loan losses from investors during the financial crisis and eventually was forced to file for bankruptcy.    The SEC previously charged three former TierOne Bank executives responsible for the scheme. Two executives agreed to settle the SEC?s charges, and the case continues against the other.    The new charges in the SEC?s case are against KPMG partner John J. Aesoph and senior manager Darren M. Bennett. The SEC?s investigation found that they failed to appropriately scrutinize management?s estimates of TierOne?s allowance for loan and lease losses (known as ALLL). Due to the financial crisis and problems in the real estate market, this was one of the highest risk areas of the audit, yet Aesoph and Bennett failed to obtain sufficient evidence supporting management?s estimates of fair value of the collateral underlying the bank?s troubled loans. Instead, they relied on stale information and management?s representations, and they failed to heed numerous red flags when issuing unqualified opinions on TierOne?s 2008 financial statements and the bank?s internal controls over its financial reporting.    ?Aesoph and Bennett merely rubber-stamped TierOne?s collateral value estimates and ignored the red flags surrounding the bank?s troubled real estate loans,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Auditors must adhere to professional auditing standards and exercise due diligence rather than merely relying on management?s representations.?    According to the SEC?s order instituting administrative proceedings against Aesoph, who lives in Omaha, and Bennett, who lives in Elkhorn, Neb., the auditors failed to comply with professional auditing standards in their substantive audit procedures over the bank?s valuation of loan losses resulting from impaired loans. They relied principally on stale appraisals and management?s uncorroborated representations of current value despite evidence that management?s estimates were biased and inconsistent with independent market data. Aesoph and Bennett failed to exercise the appropriate professional skepticism and obtain sufficient evidence that management?s collateral value and loan loss estimates were reasonable.    According to the SEC?s order, the internal controls identified and tested by the auditing engagement team did not effectively test management?s use of stale and inadequate appraisals to value the collateral underlying the bank?s troubled loan portfolio. For example, the auditors identified TierOne?s Asset Classification Committee as a key ALLL control. But there was no reference in the audit work papers to whether or how the committee assessed the value of the collateral underlying individual loans evaluated for impairment, and the committee did not generate or review written documentation to support management?s assumptions. Given the complete lack of documentation, Aesoph and Bennett had insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the bank?s internal controls for valuation of collateral were effective.    The SEC?s order alleges that Aesoph and Bennett engaged in improper professional conduct as defined in Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission?s Rules of Practice. A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to determine whether the allegations contained in the order are true and what, if any, remedial sanctions are appropriate pursuant to Rule 102(e). The administrative law judge will issue an initial decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of the order.

737,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Egan-Jones Ratings Company (EJR) and its president Sean Egan have agreed to settle charges that they made willful and material misstatements and omissions when registering with the SEC to become a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) for asset-backed securities and government securities. EJR and Egan consented to an SEC order that found EJR falsely stated in its registration application that the firm had been rating issuers of asset-backed and government securities since 1995 ? when in truth the firm had not issued such ratings prior to filing its application.  The SEC?s order also found that EJR violated conflict-of-interest provisions, and that Egan caused EJR's violations. EJR and Egan made a settlement offer that the Commission determined to accept.  Under the settlement, EJR and Egan agreed to be barred for at least 18 months from rating asset-backed and government securities issuers as an NRSRO.  EJR and Egan also agreed to correct the deficiencies found by SEC examiners in 2012, and submit a report ? signed by Egan under penalty of perjury ? detailing steps the firm has taken. ?Accuracy and transparency in the registration process are essential to the Commission?s oversight of credit rating agencies,? said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?EJR and Egan?s misrepresentation of the firm?s actual experience rating issuers of asset-backed and government securities is a serious violation that undercuts the integrity of the SEC?s NRSRO registration process.? Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement, added, ?Provisions requiring NRSROs to retain certain records and address conflicts of interest are central to the SEC?s oversight of credit rating agencies.  EJR?s violations of these provisions were significant and recurring.? Egan and his firm were charged last year for falsely stating on EJR?s July 2008 application to the SEC that it had 150 outstanding asset-backed securities (ABS) issuer ratings and 50 outstanding government issuer ratings, and had been issuing credit ratings in these categories on a continuous basis since 1995.  Egan signed and certified the application as accurate.  According to the SEC?s order, EJR had not issued any ABS or government issuer ratings that were made available through the Internet or any other readily accessible means.  Therefore, EJR did not meet the requirements for registration as a NRSRO in these classes.  The Commission found that EJR continued to make material misrepresentations about its experience in subsequent annual certifications.  EJR also made other misstatements in submissions to the SEC, and violated recordkeeping and conflict-of-interest provisions governing NRSROs ? which are intended to safeguard the integrity of credit ratings.  EJR and Egan agreed to certain undertakings in the SEC?s order, including that they must conduct a comprehensive self-review and implement policies, procedures, practices, and internal controls that correct issues identified in the SEC?s order and in the 2012 examination of EJR conducted by the SEC?s Office of Credit Ratings.  EJR and Egan consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the findings.  The order requires them to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations.

According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in  Connecticut, Jesse Litvak arranged trades for  customers as part of his job as a managing director on the MBS desk at Jefferies.? Litvak would buy a  MBS from one customer and sell it to another customer, but on many occasions he  lied about the price at which his firm had bought the MBS so he could re-sell  it to the other customer at a higher price and keep more money for the  firm.? On other occasions, Litvak misled purchasers by creating a fictional seller to  purport that he was arranging a MBS trade between customers when in reality he  was just selling MBS out of his firm?s inventory at a higher price.? Because MBS are generally illiquid and  difficult to price, it is particularly important for brokers to provide honest  and accurate information.?  The SEC alleges that Litvak generated  more than $2.7 million in additional revenue for Jefferies through his deceit.? His misconduct helped him improve his own  standing at the firm, as his bonuses were determined in part by the amount of  revenue he generated for the firm. ?Brokers must always tell their customers the truth,  particularly in complex securities transactions in which it is difficult for  investors to determine market prices on their own,? said George Canellos,  Deputy Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Litvak repeatedly lied to his customers and invented facts to  bring additional profits into his firm and ultimately his own pocket at their  expense.?

739,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the State of Illinois with securities fraud for misleading municipal bond investors about the state?s approach to funding its pension obligations.  An SEC investigation revealed that Illinois failed to inform investors about the impact of problems with its pension funding schedule as the state offered and sold more than $2.2 billion worth of municipal bonds from 2005 to early 2009. Illinois failed to disclose that its statutory plan significantly underfunded the state?s pension obligations and increased the risk to its overall financial condition. The state also misled investors about the effect of changes to its statutory plan.  Illinois, which implemented a number of remedial actions and issued corrective disclosures beginning in 2009, agreed to settle the SEC?s charges. ?Municipal investors are no less entitled to truthful risk disclosures than other investors,? said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Time after time, Illinois failed to inform its bond investors about the risk to its financial condition posed by the structural underfunding of its pension system.? Elaine Greenberg, Chief of the SEC?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, added, ?Regardless of the funding methodology they choose, municipal issuers must provide accurate and complete pension disclosures including the effects of material changes to their pension plans. Public pension disclosure by municipal issuers continues to be a top priority of the unit.?  According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings against Illinois, the state established a 50-year pension contribution schedule in the Illinois Pension Funding Act that was enacted in 1994. The schedule proved insufficient to cover both the cost of benefits accrued in a current year and a payment to amortize the plans? unfunded actuarial liability. The statutory plan structurally underfunded the state?s pension obligations and backloaded the majority of pension contributions far into the future. This structure imposed significant stress on the pension systems and the state?s ability to meet its competing obligations ? a condition that worsened over time.  The SEC?s order finds that Illinois misled investors about the effect of changes to its funding plan, particularly pension holidays enacted in 2005. Although the state disclosed the pension holidays and other legislative amendments to the plan, Illinois did not disclose the effect of those changes on the contribution schedule and its ability to meet its pension obligations. The state?s misleading disclosures resulted from various institutional failures. As a result, Illinois lacked proper mechanisms to identify and evaluate relevant information about its pension systems into its disclosures. For example, Illinois had not adopted or implemented sufficient controls, policies, or procedures to ensure that material information about the state?s pension plan was assembled and communicated to individuals responsible for bond disclosures. The state also did not adequately train personnel involved in the disclosure process or retain disclosure counsel.  According to the SEC?s order, Illinois took multiple steps beginning in 2009 to correct process deficiencies and enhance its pension disclosures. The state issued significantly improved disclosures in the pension section of its bond offering documents, retained disclosure counsel, and instituted written policies and procedures as well as implemented disclosure controls and training programs. The state designated a disclosure committee to assemble and evaluate pension disclosures. In reaching a settlement, the Commission considered these and other remedial acts by Illinois and its cooperation with SEC staff during the investigation. Without admitting or denying the findings, Illinois consented to the SEC?s order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Peter K. M. Chan along with Paul M. G. Helms in the Chicago Regional Office and Eric A. Celauro and Sally J. Hewitt in the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. They were assisted by other specialists in the unit including Joseph O. Chimienti, Creighton Papier, and Jonathan Wilcox.

Illinois, which implemented a number of remedial actions and issued corrective disclosures beginning in 2009, agreed to settle the SEC?s charges. ?Municipal investors are no less entitled to truthful risk disclosures than other investors,? said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?Time after time, Illinois failed to inform its bond investors about the risk to its financial condition posed by the structural underfunding of its pension system.? Elaine Greenberg, Chief of the SEC?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, added, ?Regardless of the funding methodology they choose, municipal issuers must provide accurate and complete pension disclosures including the effects of material changes to their pension plans. Public pension disclosure by municipal issuers continues to be a top priority of the unit.?  According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings against Illinois, the state established a 50-year pension contribution schedule in the Illinois Pension Funding Act that was enacted in 1994. The schedule proved insufficient to cover both the cost of benefits accrued in a current year and a payment to amortize the plans? unfunded actuarial liability. The statutory plan structurally underfunded the state?s pension obligations and backloaded the majority of pension contributions far into the future. This structure imposed significant stress on the pension systems and the state?s ability to meet its competing obligations ? a condition that worsened over time.  The SEC?s order finds that Illinois misled investors about the effect of changes to its funding plan, particularly pension holidays enacted in 2005. Although the state disclosed the pension holidays and other legislative amendments to the plan, Illinois did not disclose the effect of those changes on the contribution schedule and its ability to meet its pension obligations. The state?s misleading disclosures resulted from various institutional failures. As a result, Illinois lacked proper mechanisms to identify and evaluate relevant information about its pension systems into its disclosures. For example, Illinois had not adopted or implemented sufficient controls, policies, or procedures to ensure that material information about the state?s pension plan was assembled and communicated to individuals responsible for bond disclosures. The state also did not adequately train personnel involved in the disclosure process or retain disclosure counsel.  According to the SEC?s order, Illinois took multiple steps beginning in 2009 to correct process deficiencies and enhance its pension disclosures. The state issued significantly improved disclosures in the pension section of its bond offering documents, retained disclosure counsel, and instituted written policies and procedures as well as implemented disclosure controls and training programs. The state designated a disclosure committee to assemble and evaluate pension disclosures. In reaching a settlement, the Commission considered these and other remedial acts by Illinois and its cooperation with SEC staff during the investigation.

742,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two investment advisers at Oppenheimer & Co. with misleading investors about the valuation policies and performance of a private equity fund they manage.   An SEC investigation found that Oppenheimer Asset Management and Oppenheimer Alternative Investment Management disseminated misleading quarterly reports and marketing materials stating that the fund?s holdings of other private equity funds were valued ?based on the underlying managers? estimated values.?  However, the portfolio manager of the Oppenheimer fund actually valued the fund?s largest investment at a significant markup to the underlying manager?s estimated value, a change that made the fund?s performance appear significantly better as measured by its internal rate of return. Oppenheimer agreed to pay more than $2.8 million to settle the SEC?s charges.  The Massachusetts Attorney General?s office today announced a related action and additional financial penalty against Oppenheimer. ?Honest disclosure about how investments are valued and how performance is measured is vital to private equity investors,? said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?This action against Oppenheimer for misleadingly writing up the value of illiquid investments is clear warning that the SEC will not tolerate lax disclosure practices in the marketing of private equity funds.?  According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, the Oppenheimer advisers marketed Oppenheimer Global Resource Private Equity Fund I L.P. (OGR) to investors from around October 2009 to June 2010.  OGR is a fund that invests in other private equity funds, and it was marketed primarily to pensions, foundations, and endowments as well as high net worth individuals and families. According to the SEC?s order, OGR?s largest investment ? Cartesian Investors-A LLC ? was not valued based on the underlying managers? estimated values.  OGR?s portfolio manager himself valued Cartesian at a significant markup to the underlying manager?s estimated value.  OAM?s change in valuation methodology resulted in a material increase in OGR?s performance as measured by its internal rate of return, which is a metric commonly used to compare the profitability of various investments. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the portfolio manager?s markup of OGR?s Cartesian investment increased the internal rate of return from approximately 3.8 to 38.3 percent.   ?Particularly in the current difficult fundraising environment that can incentivize private equity managers to artificially inflate portfolio valuations, firms must implement policies and procedures to ensure that investors receive performance data derived from the disclosed valuation methodology,? said Julie M. Riewe, Deputy Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit.  ?Oppenheimer failed to implement such procedures and provided investors with misleading information about its valuation policies and performance numbers.?  The SEC?s order found that former OAM employees made the following misrepresentations to potential investors:  The increase in Cartesian?s value was due to an increase in Cartesian?s performance when, in fact, the increase was attributable to the portfolio manager?s new valuation method.? A third-party valuation firm used by Cartesian?s underlying manager wrote up the value of Cartesian, which was untrue.? OGR?s underlying funds were audited by independent third-party auditors when, in fact, Cartesian was unaudited.  The SEC?s order also found that Oppenheimer Asset Management?s written policies and procedures were not reasonably designed to ensure that valuations provided to prospective and existing investors were presented in a manner consistent with written representations to investors and prospective investors.    Oppenheimer Asset Management?s conduct violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-7 and 206(4)-8.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Oppenheimer agreed to pay a $617,579 penalty and return $2,269,098 to those who invested in OGR during the time period when the misrepresentations were made.  Oppenheimer consented to a censure and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the securities laws.  The firm is required to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of its valuation policies and procedures.    Oppenheimer will pay an additional penalty of $132,421 to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the related action taken by the Massachusetts Attorney General.

743,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that New York-based hedge fund advisory firm Sigma Capital Management has agreed to pay nearly $14 million to settle charges that the firm engaged in insider trading based on nonpublic information obtained through one of its analysts about the quarterly earnings of Dell and Nvidia Corporation. The SEC?s case, borne out of its ongoing investigation into expert networks and the trading activities of hedge funds, began last year with charges against several hedge fund managers and analysts including Jon Horvath, a former analyst at Sigma Capital.  Horvath agreed to a settlement earlier this month in which he admitted liability. In a complaint filed today along with the proposed settlement in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC additionally charged Sigma Capital in the insider trading scheme and named two affiliated hedge funds ? Sigma Capital Associates and S.A.C. Select Fund ? as relief defendants that unjustly benefited from Sigma Capital?s violations.  S.A.C. Select Fund is an affiliate of S.A.C. Capital. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Horvath provided Sigma Capital portfolio managers with nonpublic details about quarterly earnings at Dell and Nvidia after he learned them through a group of hedge fund analysts with whom he regularly communicated.  Based on the confidential information, Sigma Capital traded Dell and Nvidia securities in advance of earnings announcements in 2008 and 2009 for $6.425 million in gains for its hedge fund affiliates.   Sigma Capital agreed to pay disgorgement of $6.425 million plus prejudgment interest of $1,094,161.92 and a penalty of $6.425 million.   ?Quarterly revenues and profit margins are fundamental drivers of stock prices.  By illegally obtaining these vital financial measures in advance of their public announcement, Sigma Capital secured a crystal ball revealing where the stock would likely be trading in the near future,? said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?However, the crystal ball failed to predict a costly settlement with the SEC.? Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office, added, ?Sigma Capital?s violations of the securities laws were blatant and recurring.  The firm obtained key quarterly earnings information before it was public and exploited an unfair edge over the rest of the market to reap millions of dollars in unlawful gains.? According to the SEC?s complaint, the key inside information that Horvath obtained about upcoming earnings announcements by Dell and Nvidia often differed significantly from the predictions of market analysts, who only had access to publicly available information.  Based on this inside information, Sigma Capital traded Dell and Nvidia securities in advance of four quarterly earnings announcements and reaped more than $5.2 million for its hedge fund Sigma Capital Associates.  Horvath?s inside information also enabled S.A.C. Select Fund to execute trades and avoid losses of more than $1 million. The SEC?s complaint charges Sigma Capital with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

745,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a financier masquerading as a sophisticated fund manager who defrauded investors seeking to acquire highly coveted pre-IPO shares of Facebook and other social media companies. An investigation by the SEC?s Enforcement Division found that Craig Berkman, a former Oregon gubernatorial candidate who now lives in Florida, touted to investors that he had special access to scarce sources of pre-IPO stock in Facebook, LinkedIn, Groupon, and Zynga. Instead of purchasing shares on investors? behalf as promised, Berkman misused their investments to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, fund personal expenses, and pay off claims against him in a bankruptcy case. The SEC?s Enforcement Division also charged John B. Kern of Charleston, S.C., for his participation in the fraud as legal counsel to some of Berkman?s companies.  When investors in Berkman?s phony Facebook fund began questioning what happened to their money after Facebook?s IPO occurred, Kern falsely assured them that their money was used to purchase pre-IPO Facebook stock being held for them by unnamed counterparties. ?Berkman blatantly capitalized on the market fervor preceding highly anticipated IPOs of Facebook and other social media companies to fleece investors whose cash flow he treated like an ATM to fund his own living expenses and pay court-ordered claims to victims of his past misdeeds,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office. Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office, added, ?Lawyers and others who help shady operators commit fraud in the securities markets will be held accountable for their supporting roles.  Kern was duty-bound to look out for investors? best interests, but instead he was actively colluding with Berkman to prevent investors from discovering the fraud.? In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Berkman. According to the SEC?s order instituting administrative proceedings, Berkman raised at least $13.2 million from 120 investors by selling membership interests in limited liability companies that he controlled.  Berkman defrauded investors in three different sets of offerings.  He falsely told the first set of investors he would use their money to acquire pre-IPO shares of several social media companies.  He misled the second set of investors into believing that their money would be used to purchase pre-IPO shares of Facebook or acquire a company that held pre-IPO Facebook shares.  In the third offering, Berkman falsely told investors that he would use their money to fund various new large-scale technology ventures. The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that Berkman misappropriated virtually all investor funds that he raised.  He did use $600,000 to purchase a small interest in an unrelated fund that had acquired pre-IPO Facebook stock, however that purchase did not provide any company affiliated with Berkman with ownership of Facebook shares.  One of Berkman?s companies nevertheless used a forged letter about that investment to falsely represent to investors that it owned nearly a half-million shares of Facebook stock.  Upon discovering the forgery, the fund informed Berkman that it was immediately terminating and liquidating his company?s interest, leaving it without even an indirect interest in Facebook shares. The SEC?s order details a recidivist history for Berkman.  The Oregon Division of Finance and Securities issued a cease-and-desist order and $50,000 fine against Berkman in 2001 for offering and selling convertible promissory notes without a brokerage license to Oregon residents.  In June 2008, an Oregon jury found Berkman liable in a private action for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion of investor funds, and misrepresentation to investors arising from Berkman?s involvement with a series of purported venture capital funds known as Synectic Ventures.  The court entered a $28 million judgment against Berkman.  In March 2009, Synectic filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against Berkman in Florida for his unpaid debts arising from the 2008 court judgment.  The parties to the bankruptcy proceeding reached a settlement with Berkman.   According to the SEC?s order, instead of using his own money to satisfy these past claims, Berkman spent more than $5.4 million in funds from investors in his pre-IPO offerings to make the payments in the bankruptcy settlement.  Berkman also made $4.8 million in Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors in the pre-IPO scheme, falsely telling some of them that they had made money on their investment when in reality he never purchased shares for them.  Berkman used approximately $1.6 million of investor money to make large cash withdrawals and pay his own dining and travel expenses.   According to the SEC?s order, three months after Facebook?s IPO transpired, Kern wrote and signed a memorandum addressed to concerned investors in Berkman?s purported Facebook fund.  Kern?s memorandum stated that a counterparty has ?repeatedly affirmed that it has the requisite [Facebook] shares and reconfirmed to us that we have the securities interests to which we subscribed.?  Kern knew this statement was false because the ?counterparty? had told Kern that it was terminating Berkman?s company?s interest in the fund because of the forged letter.  Kern received nearly $300,000 out of the offering proceeds.   The SEC?s order alleges that Berkman and his affiliated entities committed and caused violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and that Kern caused and aided and abetted the violations.  The administrative proceedings will determine whether a cease-and-desist order should be issued and what, if any, remedial action or financial sanctions are appropriate and in the public interest. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher M. Castano, Neil Hendelman, Layla Mayer, Vipul Soni, and George N. Stepaniuk of the New York Regional Office.

But now he is learning the true cost of his participation in the most expansive insider trading scheme ever perpetrated.? In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rengan Rajaratnam. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Rengan Rajaratnam repeatedly received valuable insider tips from his brother that he used for illegal trading in the securities of Polycom, Hilton Hotels, Clearwire Corporation, Akamai Technologies, and AMD.

According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Rengan Rajaratnam repeatedly received valuable insider tips from his brother that he used for illegal trading in the securities of Polycom, Hilton Hotels, Clearwire Corporation, Akamai Technologies, and AMD.  For example, in July 2007, he made substantial profits trading Hilton stock in his personal account based on a timely insider trading tip from Raj Rajaratnam that Hilton was about to be taken private.  Rengan Rajaratnam quickly loaded up on Hilton stock, and the price of Hilton shares jumped more than 25 percent after the news became public.  Rengan Rajaratnam cashed in his recently acquired position for an illicit profit of more than $675,000. According to the SEC?s complaint, after Raj Rajaratnam tipped him about an upcoming transaction involving Clearwire Corporation in March 2008, Rengan Rajaratnam complained to his brother that certain nonpublic information they had used to begin accumulating a position in Clearwire stock was about to be reported by the media before they could establish a larger position.  Rengan Rajaratnam nevertheless profited by more than $100,000 in his personal brokerage account and more than $230,000 for Galleon hedge funds based on trades in Clearwire securities.  The SEC?s complaint charges Rengan Rajaratnam with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Rajaratnam from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay financial penalties. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Henderson and Joseph Sansone ? members of the SEC?s Market Abuse Unit in New York ? and Matthew Watkins, Diego Brucculeri, and James D?Avino of the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC has now charged 33 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds and by other traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders located throughout the country.  The insider trading occurred in the securities of more than 15 companies for illicit gains totaling more than $96 million.",-0.125,Negative
749,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a California-based hedge fund analyst with insider trading in advance of a merger of two technology companies based on nonpublic information he received from his friend who was an executive at one of the companies. The SEC also charged the executive and another trader in the $29 million insider trading scheme. The SEC alleges that Matthew Teeple of San Clemente, Calif., was tipped in advance of a July 2008 announcement that Foundry Networks Inc. had agreed to be acquired by Brocade Communication Systems Inc. for approximately $3 billion.  Teeple?s source was Foundry?s chief information officer David Riley, a friend who he had previously given investment advice.  Teeple then caused the San Francisco-based hedge fund advisory firm where he works to buy Foundry shares in large quantities in the days leading up to the public announcement, and the hedge funds managed by the firm reaped millions of dollars in profits when Foundry?s stock value increased upon the news.  Teeple also tipped a Denver-based investment professional John Johnson who he befriended through a previous working relationship, and Johnson made illegal trades based on the nonpublic information.  Riley also tipped Teeple in advance of at least two other major announcements by Foundry, and Teeple?s firm traded on the nonpublic information to make profits or avoid losses. ?David Riley was entrusted with Foundry?s most valuable secrets, but betrayed his company and set off an explosive chain reaction of illegal tips from friend to friend for illicit profits,? said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.   Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office, added, ?Company insiders who reveal confidential information and the traders who trade on it can expect robust scrutiny from the SEC.  The charges against Riley and Teeple are a cautionary tale for those considering insider trading that should make them think twice.? In a separate action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Teeple, Riley, and Johnson. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Riley tipped Teeple on the morning of July 16 about Brocade?s impending acquisition of Foundry.  Teeple immediately shared this information with colleagues at his firm as well as Johnson and several others who purchased Foundry stock, often within minutes of communicating with Teeple.  Foundry stock climbed approximately 32 percent after the public announcement of the merger on July 21. The SEC alleges that Riley, who lives in San Jose, Calif., continued to provide material nonpublic information to Teeple about key events throughout the process of Foundry?s acquisition by Brocade, which was not fully completed until Dec. 18, 2008.  Teeple?s firm continued to profitably trade Foundry securities based on this inside information.  For example, Riley tipped Teeple in advance of an October 24 announcement that Foundry?s shareholder vote to approve the acquisition would be delayed ?given recent developments related to the transaction.?  Earlier in 2008, Riley tipped Teeple in advance of Foundry?s April 11 earnings forecast so Teeple?s firm could profitably trade in advance of the announcement. The SEC?s complaint charges Teeple, Riley, and Johnson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Riley from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Holland, William Edwards, and Joseph Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit in New York as well as Christopher Ferrante and Melissa Coppola in the New York Regional Office.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

756,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a prominent Denver-based businessman with insider trading based on confidential information he obtained from the CEO of an oil and gas company that was about to secure a huge investment. An investigation by the SEC?s Enforcement Division found that Scott Reiman obtained inside information about Delta Petroleum ahead of the company?s announcement that it had secured a $684 million investment from private investment firm Tracinda. After the major investment was publicly announced, Delta Petroleum?s stock price jumped almost 20 percent and Reiman reaped substantial illicit profits. The SEC previously charged Reiman?s source, then-CEO Roger Parker, as well as another trader, Michael Van Gilder, in this insider trading investigation. To settle the SEC?s charges, Reiman agreed to pay nearly $900,000 and be barred from the securities industry and from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years. ?Reiman took advantage of highly confidential information that he obtained through his friendship with Parker and traded on it for significant and entirely illegal profits,? said Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit. Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office, added, ?These enforcement actions against Reiman, Parker, and Van Gilder show that the SEC will unravel the story behind suspicious trades and root out corporate insiders who give away confidential information as well as those who can?t resist the temptation to trade on it.? According to the SEC?s order instituting proceedings, Reiman is the founder and president of the Denver-based investment firm Hexagon Inc. He received repeated tips from Parker about Tracinda?s potential investment in Delta Petroleum. On three occasions in late November and early December 2007, Reiman bought Delta Petroleum stock or highly speculative option contracts shortly after speaking to Parker, including once within minutes after getting off the phone with him. When Delta publicly announced the Tracinda investment on Dec. 31, 2007, the value of Reiman?s fraudulently obtained Delta Petroleum securities soared nearly 20 percent. The SEC?s order charged Reiman with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Reiman neither admitted nor denied the charges. Reiman agreed to pay disgorgement of $398,000 plus prejudgment interest of $93,567 and a penalty of $398,000. The order bars Reiman from acting as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years, bars him from the securities industry with the right to reapply for reentry after five years, and requires him to cease-and-desist from future violations.

757,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an investment banker in Toronto with insider trading by using information that he obtained through his job of pitching investment ideas to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The SEC alleges that Richard Bruce Moore, who worked at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), was attempting to obtain a role in a pending acquisition when he learned facts that allowed him to conclude that U.K.-based engineering and manufacturing company Tomkins plc was the CPPIB?s target.  Moore misappropriated the information by purchasing Tomkins American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, during the weeks leading up to the acquisition.  After the acquisition offer was announced, the closing price of Tomkins ADRs rose 27 percent, and Moore made more than $163,000 in illicit profits. Moore has agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying more than $340,000.  The Ontario Securities Commission today announced a related action against Moore for insider trading in Tomkins common stock. ?Moore spent approximately one-third of his total net worth on purchases of Tomkins securities based on information he learned in the course of his employment,? said Scott W. Friestad, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?In today?s interconnected markets, the cooperative relationships among securities regulators mean that those who choose to engage in international insider trading should expect to face consequences across the globe.?  According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the CPPIB was one of Moore?s top clients at CIBC in 2010.  His primary contact was a CPPIB managing director who was responsible for taking public companies private.  Through Moore?s interactions with the CPPIB, he learned that the Board was working on a large transaction in the United Kingdom.  He pieced together nonpublic information to conclude that the Board was going to make an offer to acquire Tomkins.   The SEC alleges that Moore used an account in the Channel Islands to purchase 51,350 Tomkins ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on June 28, 2010.  He also purchased a large number of Tomkins common shares on the London Stock Exchange.  The CPPIB and a Canadian private equity firm announced the acquisition offer for Tomkins on July 19, 2010.   The SEC?s complaint charges Moore with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  In the settlement, which is subject to court approval, Moore agreed to pay $163,293 in disgorgement, $14,905 in prejudgment interest, and a $163,293 penalty.  Moore also agreed to an SEC order that will bar him from the securities industry or participating in a penny stock offering. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by David Frohlich and Matthew L.

758,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former corporate executive living in South Florida with insider trading based on confidential information that he learned as part of a professional organization. The SEC alleges that Mark D. Begelman purchased stock in Bluegreen Corporation in advance of a public announcement by BFC Financial Corporation that it was acquiring the company.  Begelman was a member of the World Presidents? Organization (WPO), which is a global professional group of business leaders who are current or former executives at major companies.  The WPO has a specific written policy that discussions of a confidential nature are to be kept confidential.  Nonetheless, Begelman took advantage of confidential information he learned from another WPO member and illegally traded ahead of the merger announcement for nearly $15,000 in illicit profits.   Begelman has agreed to pay more than $30,000 to settle the SEC?s charges. ?As a longstanding member of a group of executive professionals, Begelman disregarded his obligation of trust and confidence by abusing and illegally profiting from his extraordinary access to material, nonpublic information,? said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC?s Miami Regional Office.   According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Begelman joined the WPO in 1991 while he was president and chief operating officer at Office Depot.  He later served as an officer at BankAtlantic Bancorp and as vice chairman of the board at Canyon Creek Food Company.  Begelman was part of a small, tightly-knit group of WPO members called Forum 91.  Begelman gleaned the nonpublic information about the merger from a fellow Forum 91 member who was a high-ranking executive at both Bluegreen and BFC. According to the SEC?s complaint, Begelman and his fellow Forum 91 members gathered for their annual retreat in the Florida Keys from Nov. 1 to Nov. 3, 2011.  During the retreat, Begelman learned from the executive that Bluegreen and BFC were in merger negotiations and planned to enter into a business combination.  Begelman e-mailed his stockbroker on November 2 instructing him to buy 25,000 shares of Bluegreen.  The next day, Begelman and his stockbroker spoke by phone, and minutes later the stockbroker entered an order to purchase 25,000 Bluegreen shares at $2.25 per share.  The purchase order was filled by Nov. 9, 2011.   The SEC alleges that Begelman purchased the shares despite the duty of trust and confidence he owed to the WPO member from whom he learned the material, nonpublic information.  After BFC issued a press release on November 14 announcing the acquisition, Bluegreen?s share price rose nearly 46 percent and Begelman sold all 25,000 of his Bluegreen shares at higher prices for $14,949.34 in illegal trading profits. The SEC?s complaint charges Begelman, who lives in Delray Beach, Fla., with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the charges, Begelman agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $14,949.34 and pay prejudgment interest of $377.22 and a penalty of $14,949.34.  He also agreed to be prohibited from serving as an officer and director of a public company for a period of at least five years.  The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC?s investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Senior Investigations Counsel Gary M. Miller under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director Elisha L. Frank.

759,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the City of Harrisburg, Pa., with securities fraud for its misleading public statements when its financial condition was deteriorating and financial information available to municipal bond investors was either incomplete or outdated. An SEC investigation found that the misleading statements were made in the city?s budget report, annual and mid-year financial statements, and a State of the City address.  This marks the first time that the SEC has charged a municipality for misleading statements made outside of its securities disclosure documents.  Harrisburg has agreed to settle the charges. The SEC found that Harrisburg failed to comply with requirements to provide certain ongoing financial information and audited financial statements for the benefit of investors holding hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds issued or guaranteed by the city.  As a result of Harrisburg?s non-compliance from 2009 to 2011, investors had to seek out Harrisburg?s other public statements in order to obtain current information about the city?s finances.  However, very little information about the city?s fiscal situation was publicly available elsewhere.  Information that was accessible on the city?s website such as its 2009 budget, 2009 State of the City address, and 2009 mid-year fiscal report either misstated or failed to disclose critical information about Harrisburg?s financial condition and credit ratings. The SEC separately issued a report today addressing the disclosure obligations of public officials and their potential liability under the federal securities laws for public statements made in the secondary market for municipal securities. ?In an information vacuum caused by Harrisburg?s failure to provide accurate information about its deteriorating financial condition, municipal investors had to rely on other public statements misrepresenting city finances,? said George S. Canellos, Co-Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.  ?Statements that are reasonably expected to reach the securities markets, even if not prepared for that purpose, cannot be materially misleading.?  Elaine C. Greenberg, Chief of the SEC?s Enforcement Division?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, said, ?A municipal issuer?s obligation to provide accurate and timely material information to investors is an ongoing one.  Because of Harrisburg?s misrepresentations, secondary market investors made trading decisions based on inaccurate and stale information.? According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Harrisburg is a near-bankrupt city under state receivership largely due to approximately $260 million in debt the city had guaranteed for upgrades and repairs to a municipal resource recovery facility owned by The Harrisburg Authority.  As of March 15, 2013, Harrisburg has missed approximately $13.9 million in general obligation debt service payments.   According to the SEC?s order, Harrisburg had not submitted annual financial information or audited financial statements since submitting its 2007 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) to a Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository (NRMSIR) in January 2009.  Beginning in July 2009, Harrisburg was obligated to submit financial information and notices such as principal and interest payment delinquencies and changes in bond ratings to a central repository known as the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system maintained by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  Harrisburg did not submit its 2008 CAFR to EMMA, instead erroneously submitting it to a former NRMSIR on March 2, 2010.  Harrisburg did not submit its 2009 CAFR to EMMA until Aug. 6, 2012, and did not submit its 2010 CAFR to EMMA until Dec. 20, 2012.  The city did not submit material event notices about its failure to submit annual financial information or its credit rating downgrades until March 29, 2011, after the SEC had commenced its investigation.  Therefore, the SEC?s order finds that at a time of increased interest in the Harrisburg?s financial health due to the deteriorating financial condition of The Harrisburg Authority, the city created a risk that investors could purchase or sell securities in the secondary market on the basis of incomplete and outdated information.  For current information, investors had to review other public statements from the city about its fiscal situation.  For example, Harrisburg?s 2009 budget and its accompanying transmittal letter were accessible on Harrisburg?s website.   By the time the 2009 budget was passed, Harrisburg was aware of the Authority?s projected budget deficits and that Dauphin County was challenging a rate increase.  As a result, the Authority was unlikely to have sufficient revenues to pay its 2009 debt service obligations.  However, Harrisburg?s 2009 budget as adopted did not include funds for debt guarantee payments. The 2009 budget also misstated Harrisburg?s credit as being rated ?Aaa? by Moody?s when in fact Moody?s had downgraded Harrisburg?s general obligation credit rating to Baa1 by December 2008.   According to the SEC?s order, another public statement available to investors on the city?s website was the annual State of the City address delivered on April 9, 2009.  The address only discussed the municipal resource recovery facility as a situation that was an ?additional challenge? and an ?issue that can be resolved.?  The address was misleading because it failed to mention that by this time, Harrisburg had already made $1.8 million in guarantee payments on the resource recovery facility bond debt.  It also omitted the total amount of the debt that the city would likely have to repay from its general fund.  By this time, Harrisburg knew that the Authority had failed to secure the requested rate increase, making it likely that Harrisburg would have to repay $260 million of the debt as guarantor. According to the SEC?s order, Harrisburg?s 2009 mid-year fiscal report available on its website was designed to provide a snapshot of budget-to-actual figures at the middle of the year.  However, the report did not reference any of the guarantee payments the city had made on the municipal resource recovery facility debt, which at this mid-year point totaled $2.3 million (7 percent of its general fund expenditures). The SEC?s order requires Harrisburg to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The city neither admits nor denies the findings in the order.  In the settlement, the SEC considered Harrisburg?s cooperation in the investigation and the various remedial measures implemented by the city to prevent further securities laws violations.   The SEC?s investigation was conducted by members of the Enforcement Division?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit including Senior Enforcement Counsel Yolanda Gonzalez and Assistant Director Ivonia K. Slade with assistance from Municipal Securities Specialist Jonathan D. Wilcox.  The investigation was supervised by Unit Chief Elaine C. Greenberg and Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner. *  *  * In its Report of Investigation to address the secondary market disclosure responsibilities of public officials when they make public statements about a municipal issuer, the SEC notes that public officials should be mindful that their written or oral public statements may affect the total mix of information available to investors.   This could result in anti-fraud liability under the federal securities laws for the public officials making such statements if they are materially misleading or omit material information. The report further states that public officials should consider taking steps to reduce the risk of misleading investors.  At a minimum, they should consider adopting policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to result in accurate, timely, and complete public disclosures; identifying those persons involved in the disclosure process; evaluating other public disclosures including financial information made by the municipal issuer; and assuring that responsible individuals receive adequate training about their obligations under the federal securities laws.",-0.3137254901960784,Negative
760,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged charged Rockville, Md.-based proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) for failing to safeguard the confidential proxy voting information of clients participating in a number of significant proxy contests. An SEC investigation found that an employee at ISS provided a proxy solicitor with material, nonpublic information revealing how more than 100 ISS institutional shareholder advisory clients were voting their proxy ballots. In exchange for voting information, the proxy solicitor provided the ISS employee with meals, expensive tickets to concerts and sporting events, and an airline ticket. The breach was made possible in part because ISS lacked sufficient controls over employee access to confidential client vote information, as this employee gathered the data by logging into the ISS voting website from home or work and using his personal e-mail account to communicate details to the proxy solicitor. The employee no longer works at ISS. ISS, which is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser, agreed to settle the charges by paying $300,000 and retaining an independent compliance consultant. ""Proxy advisers must tailor their controls based on the risks of their particular business in order to protect the integrity of the proxy voting process,"" said Julie M. Riewe, Deputy Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. ""The internal controls at ISS did not adequately address the potential misuse of confidential proxy voting information by firm employees."" According to the SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings, the breach occurred from approximately 2007 to 2012. ISS failed to establish or enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information by ISS employees. Specifically, ISS lacked sufficient controls over employee access to databases of confidential client vote information. The SEC's order finds that ISS willfully violated Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The order censures the firm and requires ISS to pay a $300,000 penalty and engage an independent compliance consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures. The consultant will evaluate whether ISS's procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that its proxy voting services business complies with the Advisers Act in its treatment of confidential information, communications with proxy solicitors, and gifts and entertainment. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, ISS agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 204A.

761,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged France-based oil and gas company Total S.A. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying $60 million in bribes to intermediaries of an Iranian government official who then exercised his influence to help the company obtain valuable contracts to develop significant oil and gas fields in Iran.   The SEC alleges that Total made more than $150 million in profits through the bribery scheme.  Total attempted to cover up the true nature of the illegal payments by entering into sham consulting agreements with intermediaries of the Iranian official and mischaracterizing the bribes in its books and records as legitimate ?business development expenses? related to the consulting agreements.  Total had inadequate systems to properly review the consulting agreements and lacked sufficient internal controls to comply with federal laws prohibiting bribery. Total, whose securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to pay more than $398 million to settle the SEC?s charges and a parallel criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.  ?Total used illicit payments to win business in Iran, and reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.  ?Total must now pay back all of its profits from the company?s corrupt conduct and additionally pay criminal penalties on top of that.? According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Total negotiated a development contract in 1995 with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the country?s Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.  Prior to executing the contract, Total held a meeting with the Iranian official and agreed to enter into a purported consulting agreement with an intermediary he designated.  They agreed that Total would make payments to the intermediary under the guise of a consulting agreement when the real purpose was to induce the Iranian official to use his influence to help obtain NIOC?s approval of the development agreement.  After the contract was executed, Total corruptly made the bribery payments that resulted in NIOC allowing Total to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields and make more than $150 million in profits. The SEC?s order requires Total to pay disgorgement of $153 million in illicit profits and retain an independent compliance consultant to review and report on Total?s compliance with the FCPA.  Total also must cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 30A, Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the parallel criminal proceedings, Total agreed to pay a $245.2 million penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.

762,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a South Pasadena, Calif.-based wealth management company and a former fund manager with insider trading on non-public information about technology companies.  The charges are the agency?s latest in its ongoing investigation into expert networks and hedge fund trading. The SEC alleges that Whittier Trust Company and fund manager Victor Dosti participated in an insider trading scheme involving the securities of Dell, Nvidia Corporation, and Wind River Systems.  Dosti generated profits and avoided losses for funds he managed at Whittier Trust by trading on confidential information that he obtained from Danny Kuo, a Whittier Trust fund manager who Dosti supervised.  Kuo was charged by the SEC in January 2012 and is currently cooperating with the investigation. Whittier Trust and Dosti agreed to pay nearly $1.7 million to settle the charges.   ?Time and again, Dosti received what he knew was inside information from Kuo and traded on it to generate illicit gains for the funds he managed,? said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.  ?Now, he and Whittier Trust join a long list of insider trading perpetrators who have been held accountable by the SEC for their transgressions.? The SEC has charged more than three dozen individuals and firms in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms.  The first series of charges were brought in 2011. According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Dosti used non-public information obtained from employees at Dell and Nvidia to trade in advance of five quarterly earnings announcements in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  Dosti reaped profits and avoided losses of more than $475,000 for Whittier Trust funds.  Dosti also made $247,000 in illicit profits for Whittier Trust funds by trading Wind River stock based upon detailed information that Kuo obtained from an Intel employee about Intel?s confidential negotiations to acquire Wind River in 2009. The SEC?s complaint charges Whittier Trust and Dosti with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Whittier Trust agreed to pay disgorgement of $724,051.62 plus prejudgment interest of $75,296.00 and a penalty of $724,051.62.  Dosti agreed to pay disgorgement of $77,900.00 plus prejudgment interest of $2,951.43, and a penalty of $77,900.00.

763,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and an affiliate for various systemic breakdowns in their regulatory and compliance functions as a self-regulatory organization, including a failure to enforce or even fully comprehend rules to prevent abusive short selling. CBOE agreed to pay a $6 million penalty and implement major remedial measures to settle the SEC's charges. The financial penalty is the first assessed against an exchange for violations related to its regulatory oversight. Previous financial penalties against exchanges involved misconduct on the business side of their operations. Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) must enforce the federal securities laws as well as their own rules to regulate trading on their exchanges by their member firms. In doing so, they must sufficiently manage an inherent conflict that exists between self-regulatory obligations and the business interests of an SRO and its members. An SEC investigation found that CBOE failed to adequately police and control this conflict for a member firm that later became the subject of an SEC enforcement action. CBOE put the interests of the firm ahead of its regulatory obligations by failing to properly investigate the firm's compliance with Regulation SHO and then interfering with the SEC investigation of the firm. According to the SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings, CBOE demonstrated an overall inability to enforce Reg. SHO with an ineffective surveillance program that failed to detect wrongdoing despite numerous red flags that its members were engaged in abusive short selling. CBOE also fell short in its regulatory and compliance responsibilities in several other areas during a four-year period. ""The proper regulation of the markets relies on SROs to aggressively police their member firms and enforce their rules as well as the securities laws,"" said Andrew J. Ceresney, Co-Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""When SROs fail to regulate responsibly the conduct of their member firms as CBOE did here, we will not hesitate to bring an enforcement action."" Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, added, ""CBOE's failures in this case were disappointing. The public depends on SROs to provide a watchful eye on their exchanges and market activities occurring through them. They must have strong compliance cultures and adequate and dedicated compliance resources to ensure that they do not stray from their bedrock obligation to provide rigorous self-regulation."" According to the SEC's order, CBOE moved its surveillance and monitoring of Reg. SHO compliance from one department to another in 2008, and the transfer of responsibilities adversely affected its Reg. SHO enforcement program. After that transfer, CBOE did not take action against any firm for violations of Reg. SHO as a result of its surveillance or complaints from third parties. Reg. SHO requires the delivery of equity securities to a registered clearing agency when delivery is due, generally three days after the trade date (T 3). If no delivery is made by that time, the firm must purchase or borrow the securities to close out that failure-to-deliver position by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the next day (T 4). CBOE failed to adequately enforce Reg. SHO because its staff lacked a fundamental understanding of the rule. CBOE investigators responsible for Reg. SHO surveillance never received any formal training. CBOE never ensured that its investigators even read the rules. Therefore, they did not have a basic understanding of a failure to deliver. According to the SEC's order, CBOE received a complaint in February 2009 about possible short sale violations involving a customer account at a member firm. CBOE began investigating whether the trading activity violated Rule 204T of Reg. SHO. However, CBOE staff assigned to the case did not know how to determine if a fail existed and were confused about whether Reg. SHO applied to a retail customer. CBOE closed its Reg. SHO investigation later that year. The SEC's order found that not only did CBOE fail to adequately detect violations and investigate and discipline one of its members, but it also took misguided and unprecedented steps to assist that same member firm when it became the subject of an SEC investigation in December 2009. CBOE failed to provide information to SEC staff when requested, and went so far as to assist the member firm by providing information for its Wells submission to the SEC. The CBOE actually edited the firm's draft submission, and some of the information and edits provided by CBOE were inaccurate and misleading. The SEC brought its enforcement action against the firm in April 2012, and an administrative law judge recently rendered an initial decision in that case. According to the SEC's order, CBOE had a number of other regulatory and compliance failures at various times between 2008 and 2012. CBOE failed to adequately enforce its firm quote and priority rules for certain orders and trades on its exchange as well as rules requiring the registration of persons associated with its proprietary trading members. CBOE also provided unauthorized ""customer accommodation"" payments to some members and not others without applicable rules in place, resulting in unfair discrimination. And CBOE and affiliate C2 Options Exchange failed to file proposed rule changes with the SEC when certain trading functions on their exchanges were implemented. The SEC's order finds that CBOE violated Section 19(b)(1) and Section 19(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act as well as Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-1 when it failed to promptly provide information requested by the SEC that the exchange kept in the course of its business, including information related to the member firm that was under SEC investigation for Reg. SHO violations. CBOE and C2 agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. CBOE agreed to pay $6 million, accept a censure and cease-and-desist order, and implement significant undertakings. C2 also agreed to a censure and cease-and-desist order and significant undertakings.   After the SEC began its investigation, CBOE and C2 responded by engaging in voluntary remedial efforts and initiatives. In reaching the settlement, the SEC took into account these remediation efforts and initiatives. CBOE reorganized its Regulatory Services Division, and hired a chief compliance officer and two deputy chief regulatory officers. CBOE updated written policies and procedures, increased the regulatory budget and the hiring of regulatory staff, implemented mandatory training for all staff and management, and hired a third-party consultant to review its Reg. SHO enforcement program. CBOE also conducted a ""bottom-up"" review of its Regulatory Services Division's independence, began a ""gap"" analysis to determine whether CBOE or C2 needed to file any additional rules, and reviewed all of CBOE's regulatory surveillances and the exchange's enterprise risk management framework. After the SEC expressed concern about an accommodation payment to a member, CBOE hired outside counsel to investigate and self-reported additional instances of financial accommodations to other members. After considering CBOE's remedial efforts, the SEC determined not to impose limitations upon the activities, functions or operations of CBOE pursuant to Section 19(h)(1) of the Exchange Act. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Market Abuse Unit members Paul E. Kim and Deborah A. Tarasevich and Structured and New Products Unit member Jill S. Henderson with assistance from market surveillance specialist Brian Shute and trading strategies specialist Ainsley Kerr. The case was supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Daniel M.

Cohen?s hedge funds earned profits and avoided losses of more than $275 million as a result of the illegal trades.      ?Hedge fund managers are responsible for exercising appropriate supervision over their employees to ensure that their firms comply with the securities laws,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Co-Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?After learning about red flags indicating potential insider trading by his employees, Steven Cohen allegedly failed to follow up to prevent violations of the law.? In addition to the more than $615 million his firm has already agreed to pay for the alleged insider trading, the Enforcement Division is seeking to bar Cohen from overseeing investor funds.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting administrative proceedings against Cohen, portfolio managers Martoma and Steinberg obtained material non-public information about publicly traded companies in 2008, and they traded on the basis of that information. ?The SEC charged Martoma and his tipper with insider trading in an enforcement action last year, and charged Steinberg with insider trading in a complaint filed earlier this year. ?In connection with those cases, CR Intrinsic, an affiliate of Cohen?s firm S.A.C. Capital Advisors, agreed to pay more than $600 million in the largest-ever insider trading settlement.? Another Cohen affiliate, Sigma Capital, agreed to pay nearly $14 million to settle insider trading charges.      The SEC?s investigation found that in his supervisory role, Cohen oversaw trading by Martoma and Steinberg and required them to update him on their stock trading and convey the reasons for their trades. ?On at least two separate occasions in 2008, they provided information to Cohen indicating their potential access to inside information to support their trading. ?However, Cohen stood by on both occasions instead of ascertaining whether insider trading was taking place.      According to the SEC?s order, Cohen watched Martoma build a massive long position in the stock of two pharmaceutical companies ? Elan and Wyeth ? based on their joint clinical trial of a drug with the potential to treat Alzheimer?s disease. ?Cohen allowed this despite repeated e-mails and instant messages to Cohen from other analysts at CR Intrinsic advocating against it. ?The analysts questioned whether Martoma possessed undisclosed data on the results of the trial.? Cohen responded by saying it was ?tough? to know whether Martoma knew something, but that he would follow Martoma?s advice because he was ?closer to it than you.?? In later exchanges of instant messages, Cohen further remarked that it ?seems like mat [Martoma] has a lot of good relationships in this arena.?? Cohen also was told about a doctor who had provided his portfolio managers with potentially non-public information about the clinical trial, but failed to express any concern about the use of that information.? During his e-mail exchanges, Cohen displayed no concern that Martoma might possess non-public information or about his use of such information to inform investment decisions at his firm.? Instead, Cohen encouraged Martoma to talk further with a doctor familiar with the clinical trial.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that after months of building up the massive position and being bullish on both Elan and Wyeth, Martoma had a 20-minute phone conversation with Cohen on July 20, 2008. ?According to Cohen, Martoma said that he was no longer comfortable with the Elan investments that CR Intrinsic and SAC held.? Despite Martoma?s abrupt change in view and red flags that he likely received confidential information about the clinical trials from a tipper, Cohen failed to take prompt action to determine whether an employee under his supervision was violating insider trading laws.? Starting the next morning, Cohen oversaw the liquidation of his and Martoma?s positions in Elan and Wyeth and the accumulation of a short position instead.      According to the SEC?s order, Cohen also supervised Steinberg while he was involved in insider trading of Dell securities in August 2008.? After being looped into a highly suspicious e-mail between Steinberg and other firm employees reflecting the clear possibility that they possessed material non-public information about an upcoming earnings announcement at Dell, Cohen again failed to take prompt action to determine whether Steinberg was engaged in unlawful insider trading.? Instead, Cohen liquidated his Dell shares based on the recommendation of Steinberg, who continued short selling Dell shares in his Sigma Capital portfolio based on the confidential information. ?Dell?s stock price dropped sharply after its August 28 earnings announcement, and funds managed by Cohen?s firms profited or avoided losses totaling at least $1.7 million. ?Three hours after the earnings announcement, Cohen e-mailed Steinberg: ?Nice job on Dell.?      The SEC?s Division of Enforcement alleges that by engaging in the conduct described in the SEC?s order, Cohen failed reasonably to supervise Martoma and Steinberg with a view to preventing their violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.? The administrative proceedings will determine what relief is in the public interest against Cohen, including financial penalties, a supervisory and financial services industry bar, and other relief.      The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Joseph Sansone, Charles Riely, and Daniel Marcus of the Market Abuse Unit in New York as well as Amelia Cottrell, Matthew Watkins, Justin Smith, Neil Hendelman, Diego Brucculeri, and James D?Avino of the New York Regional Office.?

771,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the city of Miami and its former budget director with securities fraud in connection with several municipal bond offerings and other disclosures made to investors.?      An SEC investigation found that beginning in 2008, Miami and Michael Boudreaux made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about certain interfund transfers in three 2009 bond offerings totaling $153.5 million.? They similarly included false and misleading information in the city?s fiscal year 2007 and 2008 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs) that are distributed to broad segments of the investing public, including investors in previously issued city debt.? Boudreaux orchestrated the transfers from the city?s Capital Improvement Fund to its General Fund in order to mask increasing deficits in the General Fund, which is viewed by investors and bond rating agencies as a key indicator of financial health.      The SEC?s action also charges Miami with violating an SEC cease-and-desist order that was entered against the city in 2003 based on similar misconduct.? This is the first time the SEC has alleged further wrongdoing by a municipality subject to an existing SEC cease-and-desist order.      ?Miami actively marketed bonds to the investing public while hiding the true reason for interfund transfers to boost the image of its primary operating fund,? said George S. Canellos, Co-Director of the Division of Enforcement.? ?The fact that a city official would enable these false and misleading disclosures to investors merely a few years after Miami had been reprimanded by the SEC for similar misconduct makes this repeat behavior all the more appalling and unacceptable.? We will hold accountable not only municipalities, but also individual municipal officials for fraudulent disclosures to investors.?      Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC?s Miami Regional Office, added, ?Miami cannot continue to play shell games with its finances.? Investors and the markets deserve complete transparency in assessing the city?s municipal bond offerings.??      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Boudreaux initiated the city?s transfer of approximately $37.5 million between the funds.? Miami did not disclose to bondholders that the transferred funds included legally restricted dollars which, under city code, may not be commingled with any other funds or revenues of the city.? Miami also failed to disclose that the transferred funds were allocated to specific capital projects that still needed those funds as of the end of the fiscal year, or in some instances already had spent that money.? The transfers enabled Miami to meet or come close to meeting its own requirements relating to the General Fund?s reserve levels.? In the wake of the transfers, the city?s bond offerings were all rated favorably by credit rating agencies.      According to the SEC?s complaint, Miami was forced to reverse most of the transfers following a report by its Office of Independent Auditor General (OIAG).? The city then declared a state of fiscal urgency once it failed to meet statutorily mandated fund levels in its General Fund, and bond rating agencies consequently downgraded their ratings on the city?s debt.      The SEC?s complaint charges Miami with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.? It also charges the city with violating the SEC?s 2003 cease-and-desist order.? The complaint charges Boudreaux with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and violations and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.? The SEC?s complaint seeks injunctive relief and financial penalties against Miami and Boudreaux, and an order commanding the city to comply with the SEC?s 2003 order.      The SEC?s investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Rachel K. Paulose, Andre J. Zamorano, and Michelle Lama under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay.?

772,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Texas man and his company with defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin, a virtual currency traded on online exchanges for conventional currencies like the U.S. dollar or used to purchase goods or services online.?      The SEC alleges that Trendon T. Shavers, who is the founder and operator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), offered and sold Bitcoin-denominated investments through the Internet using the monikers ?Pirate? and ?pirateat40.?? Shavers raised at least 700,000 Bitcoin in BTCST investments, which amounted to more than $4.5 million based on the average price of Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 when the investments were offered and sold.? Today the value of 700,000 Bitcoin exceeds $60 million.      The SEC alleges that Shavers promised investors up to 7 percent weekly interest based on BTCST?s Bitcoin market arbitrage activity, which supposedly included selling to individuals who wished to buy Bitcoin ?off the radar? in quick fashion or large quantities.? In reality, BTCST was a sham and a Ponzi scheme in which Shavers used Bitcoin from new investors to make purported interest payments and cover investor withdrawals on outstanding BTCST investments.? Shavers also diverted investors? Bitcoin for day trading in his account on a Bitcoin currency exchange, and exchanged investors? Bitcoin for U.S. dollars to pay his personal expenses.      The SEC issued an investor alert today warning investors about the dangers of potential investment scams involving virtual currencies promoted through the Internet.?      ?Fraudsters are not beyond the reach of the SEC just because they use Bitcoin or another virtual currency to mislead investors and violate the federal securities laws,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.? ?Shavers preyed on investors in an online forum by claiming his investments carried no risk and huge profits for them while his true intentions were rooted in nothing more than personal greed.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Shavers sold BTCST investments over the Internet to investors in such states as Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.? Shavers posted general solicitations on a website dedicated to Bitcoin discussions, and he misled investors with such false assurances about his investment opportunity as ?It?s growing, it?s growing!? and ?I have yet to come close to taking a loss on any deal,? and ?risk is almost 0.?? Contrary to the representations made to investors, BTCST was not in the business of buying and selling Bitcoin at all.      The SEC alleges that Shavers, who lives in McKinney, Texas, paid 507,148 Bitcoin in investor withdrawals and purported interest payments.? He transferred at least 150,649 Bitcoin to his personal account at an online Bitcoin currency exchange.? Shavers suffered a net loss from his day trading, but realized net proceeds of $164,758 from his sales of 86,202 Bitcoin.? Shavers transferred $147,102 from his personal account at the online Bitcoin currency exchange to accounts he controlled at an online payment processor as well as his personal checking account.? He used this money to pay his rent, utilities, and car-related expenses as well as for food and retail purchases and gambling.      The SEC?s complaint charges Shavers and BTCST with offering and selling investments in violation of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.? The SEC is seeking a court order to freeze the assets of Shavers and BTCST in addition to other relief, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.      The SEC?s investor alert, prepared by the agency?s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, recommends that investors be wary of so-called investment opportunities that promise high rates of return with little or no risk, especially when dealing with unregistered, Internet-based investments sold by unlicensed promoters.      ?Ponzi scheme operators often claim to have a tie to a new and emerging technology as a lure to potential victims,? said Lori J. Schock, Director of the SEC?s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. ??Investors should understand that regardless of the type of investment, a promise of high returns with little or no risk is a classic warning sign of fraud.?",-0.21875,Negative

Capital hedge fund that he managed to generate more than $1.5 million in illegal profits.? Lee also made trades in his personal account.? The insider trading occurred ahead of public announcements about a Microsoft-Yahoo partnership and the acquisition of 3Com Corporation by Hewlett-Packard.?      ?Lee?s illegal trading is yet another byproduct of a pervasive, win-at-all-cost culture that will not be tolerated,? said George S.

According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lee received inside information in July 2009 from a sell-side analyst familiar with nonpublic negotiations between Microsoft and Yahoo to enter into an Internet search engine partnership.? Lee learned that the negotiations, previously the subject of market rumors, were moving forward and a deal could be finalized in the next two weeks.? The analyst told Lee that the confidential information came from a close personal friend who worked at Microsoft.? Lee thanked the analyst for the ?very specific information? and promptly purchased hundreds of thousands of shares of Yahoo stock in a portfolio that he managed on behalf of S.A.C. Capital.? Lee also purchased shares of Yahoo stock in his personal trading account.? When the imminent deal was reported in the press almost a week later, Yahoo?s stock price rose approximately four percent on the news and S.A.C. Capital and Lee reaped substantial profits.      The SEC further alleges that Lee received highly confidential information about 3Com from a Beijing-based consultant who he knew had close personal ties with executives at the company.? When his source tipped him on Nov. 11, 2009, that 3Com was on the verge of being acquired by Hewlett-Packard, Lee quickly purchased several hundred thousand shares of 3Com stock for the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund. ?On the basis of the nonpublic information, Lee amassed the sizeable 3Com position just minutes before Hewlett-Packard announced it agreed to acquire 3Com for $2.7 billion.? The price of 3Com stock jumped more than 30 percent the next day, and the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund reaped substantial illicit profits as a result of Lee?s illegal trades.      The SEC's complaint charges Lee, who lives in Chicago, with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.? The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Lee to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.      The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Thomas Smith, Michael Holland, and Joseph Sansone of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in New York as well as Melissa Coppola and Jordan Baker in the New York Regional Office.?

779,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the tipper of confidential information to a S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager who has been charged with insider trading.      The SEC today amended its complaint against Richard Lee, who was charged last week, to additionally charge Sandeep Aggarwal, a sell-side analyst who tipped Lee in advance of a July 2009 public announcement about an Internet search engine partnership between Microsoft and Yahoo.? Lee purchased large amounts of Yahoo stock in the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund that he managed as well as in his personal trading account on the basis of the inside information.      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Aggarwal, who lives in India but recently returned to the U.S.      ?Rather than rely on legitimate research methods, Aggarwal obtained confidential information from a close friend at Microsoft and passed it along to Lee knowing that he would likely trade on it,? said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.? ?As a sell-side analyst, Aggarwal knew the rules and yet he broke them, which is why he joins the growing ranks of those held accountable by the SEC for insider trading.?      The SEC alleges that Aggarwal learned confidential details about the significant progress of the Microsoft-Yahoo negotiations from his close friend at Microsoft on July 9, 2009, and he tipped Lee with the information during a telephone call the following day.? When the information was reported in the media almost a week later, Yahoo?s stock price rose approximately 4 percent.? S.A.C. Capital and Lee reaped substantial profits from the Yahoo shares that he purchased after speaking to Aggarwal.      According to the SEC?s amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Aggarwal covered both Microsoft and Yahoo for his research firm and regularly received periodic updates from his inside source at Microsoft.? Upon learning that Microsoft and Yahoo were potentially within two weeks of finalizing a deal, Aggarwal shared very specific details with Lee.? Aggarwal assured him that the information came from a close friend at Microsoft who was reliable and accurate.      The SEC?s amended complaint charges Aggarwal and Lee with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.? The amended complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Aggarwal and Lee to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.

The SEC alleges that in another iteration of his fraud, Scott offered investors the opportunity to make a bridge loan to a third-party entity.? The investor was told to fund one portion of the loan, and ACI would supposedly fund the remaining balance. ?In exchange, the investor would supposedly receive a substantial return on his initial investment.? In this scheme as with each of his others, investors never received returns and Scott stole the money.      The SEC?s complaint charges Scott with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act for filing a false Form ADV, and aiding and abetting ACI?s improper registration in violation of Section 203A of the Advisers Act.?

787,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 10 former brokers at an Albany, N.Y.-based firm at the center of a $125 million investment scheme for which the co-owners have received jail sentences.      The SEC filed an emergency action in 2010 to halt the scheme at McGinn Smith & Co. and freeze the assets of the firm and its owners Timothy M. McGinn and David L. Smith, who were later charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Northern District of New York and found guilty.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that 10 brokers who recommended the unregistered investment products involved in the scheme made material misrepresentations and omissions to their customers.? The registered representatives ignored red flags that should have led them to conduct more due diligence into the securities they were recommending to their customers.      ?As securities professionals, these brokers had an important duty to determine whether the securities they recommended to customers were suitable, especially when red flags were apparent.? These registered representatives performed inadequate due diligence and failed to fulfill their duties,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.?      The SEC?s order names 10 former McGinn Smith brokers in the administrative proceeding:      Donald J. Anthony, Jr. of Loudonville, N.Y.?     Frank H. Chiappone of Clifton Park, NY.?     Richard D. Feldmann of Delmar, N.Y.     William P. Gamello of Rexford, N.Y.?     Andrew G. Guzzetti of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.     William F. Lex of Phoenixville, Pa.     Thomas E. Livingston of Slingerlands, N.Y.?     Brian T. Mayer of Princeton, N.J.?     Philip S. Rabinovich of Roslyn, N.Y.?     Ryan C. Rogers of East Northport, N.Y.?       According to the SEC?s order, the scheme victimized approximately 750 investors and led to $80 million in investor losses. ?Guzzetti was the managing director of McGinn Smith?s private client group from 2004 to 2009, and he supervised brokers who recommended the firm?s offerings.? The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that despite his knowledge of serious red flags, Guzzetti failed to take any action to investigate the offerings and instead encouraged the brokers to sell the notes to McGinn Smith customers.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that the other nine brokers charged in the administrative proceeding should have conducted a searching inquiry prior to recommending the products to their customers. ?The brokers continued to sell McGinn Smith notes even after being told that customers placed in some of the firm?s offerings could only be redeemed if a replacement customer was found.? This was contrary to the offering documents. ?In January 2008, the brokers learned that four earlier offerings that raised almost $90 million had defaulted, yet they failed to conduct any inquiry into subsequent offerings and continued to recommend McGinn Smith notes.      The SEC?s order alleges that the misconduct of Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston, Mayer, Rabinovich, and Rogers resulted in violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.? The order alleges that Guzzetti failed to reasonably supervise the nine brokers, giving rise to liability under Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, incorporating by reference Section 15(b)(4).      The SEC?s civil case continues against the firm as well as McGinn and Smith, who were sentenced to 15 and 10 years imprisonment respectively in the criminal case.?

788,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged TD Bank and a former executive with violating securities laws in connection with a massive South Florida-based Ponzi scheme conducted by Scott Rothstein, who is now serving a 50-year prison sentence.      The SEC alleges that TD Bank and its then-regional vice president Frank A. Spinosa defrauded investors by producing a series of misleading documents and making false statements about accounts that Rothstein held at the bank and used to perpetuate his scheme.? Spinosa falsely represented to several investors that TD Bank had restricted the movement of the funds in these accounts when, in fact, Rothstein could transfer investor money however he desired.? Spinosa also orally assured investors that certain accounts held balances totaling millions of dollars, but each account actually held zero to $100.      TD Bank agreed to settle the SEC?s charges in an administrative proceeding and pay $15 million.? The SEC filed a complaint against Spinosa in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.      ?Financial institutions are key gatekeepers in the transactions and investments they facilitate and will be held to a high standard of accountability when their officers enable fraud,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Co-Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.? ?TD Bank through a regional vice president produced false documents on bank letterhead and told outright lies to investors, failing in its gatekeeper role.?      Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC?s Miami Regional Office, added, ?Spinosa played a key supporting role in Rothstein?s Ponzi scheme by providing false comfort to investors that their money was safe and secure in the accounts at TD Bank.? He enabled Rothstein to con investors into believing he couldn?t move their money when he could, and that the bank was holding money that it wasn?t.?      In previous enforcement actions, the SEC has charged two feeder funds to the Rothstein Ponzi scheme.      According to the SEC?s order and complaint, Rothstein claimed to represent plaintiffs who had reached purported legal settlements that were confidential and payable over time by large corporate defendants.? He claimed that the purported plaintiffs were willing to sell their periodic payments to investors at a discount in exchange for one lump-sum payment.? The legal settlements were fake and the plaintiffs and defendants were not real.? Rothstein told investors that the purported defendants had deposited the entire settlement amounts into attorney trust accounts.? Rothstein opened 22 such accounts at Commerce Bank and TD Bank (the two merged in 2008) from November 2007 to October 2009.?      The SEC alleges that as Rothstein?s scheme began to unravel in the fall of 2009, Spinosa made false statements to investors about the safety of their investments that enabled Rothstein to continue raising funds for the scheme.? Spinosa executed so-called ?lock letters? from TD Bank purporting to irrevocably restrict Rothstein?s trust accounts.? Under these conditions, TD Bank could only distribute funds in the accounts to the investor?s bank account designated in the lock letter.? However, the representations were purely false as Spinosa did not apply any procedures to block the accounts or implement any system to restrict Rothstein from moving money out of the trust accounts.? Spinosa also misrepresented to Rothstein?s investors that the lock letters were commonplace at TD Bank when, in fact, they were never previously used by the bank.? In fact, when Spinosa instructed his assistant to prepare the letters on TD Bank letterhead, she questioned whether it was even permissible because she had never seen such a letter before.? Spinosa confirmed that she should prepare the letter for his signature anyway.? Later, a vice president and branch manager who reported to Spinosa noted to him shortly after the first lock letter went out in August 2009 that the ?lock? instructions put onto an account would have no practical effect because Rothstein could still transfer the money without bank officials being alerted.? Spinosa dismissed those concerns.      The SEC further alleges that Spinosa provided false assurances to two different groups of investors that certain trust accounts held the multi-million dollar balances claimed by Rothstein.? On Aug. 17, 2009, Spinosa participated in a conference call with Rothstein and representatives of an investor group who asked how much money was in a particular account.? Spinosa responded that it held $22 million ? the amount the investor was expecting to hear.? Spinosa had full access to the account information to know the actual account balance was no more than $100.? The following month, Spinosa met with the same group after it made additional investments with Rothstein, and falsely assured the investors that their money was safe because the provisions of the lock letter restricted the movement of their money.? Also in September 2009, a different investor group bought a purported $20 million settlement from Rothstein, and one of the investor group?s representatives obtained a TD Bank deposit slip that indicated a $0 balance as of that morning for the account that purportedly held the investor?s $20 million.? Rothstein falsely stated that the funds were indeed in the account, but the funds would not appear ?available? on the deposit slip because they were in TD Bank?s ?federal wire queue.?? Rothstein and representatives from the investor group met with Spinosa on Sept. 14, 2009, and Spinosa falsely represented that the $20 million did not appear as available funds for the same reason provided by Rothstein.? Spinosa falsely represented that the lock letter restricted the movement of their money.? In reality, TD Bank was not holding the money in such a queue, and the account didn?t contain the $20 million.      TD Bank consented to the entry of an administrative order finding that it violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.? Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, TD Bank agreed to pay $15 million and cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act.      The SEC?s complaint against Spinosa charges him with violating Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.? Spinosa also is charged with aiding and abetting Scott Rothstein?s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.? The complaint seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and a permanent injunction.      The SEC coordinated the filing of its cases with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which today announced their own actions against TD Bank.?

789,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Manhattan-based independent filmmaker with insider trading on confidential information about impending takeovers of two biotechnology companies.      The SEC alleges that Lawrence Robbins reaped illicit profits by trading Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sepracor Inc. securities based on confidential information that he received from his business partner John Michael Bennett in advance of the acquisition announcements by the two companies. ?Bennett had received the inside information from his friend Scott Allen.? The SEC previously charged Bennett and Allen for their roles in the scheme.?      Robbins, who lives in New York City, has agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying more than $1 million.      ?Robbins plotted with his business partner to perpetrate an insider trading scheme that enabled him to invest a portion of his illegal profits in their film production company,? said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director for Enforcement in the SEC?s New York Regional Office.? ?Their plot, however, did not account for the real world consequences of being caught by the SEC.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Allen learned confidential information in advance of the two acquisitions through his job at a global consulting firm that was advising the acquiring company in each deal.? Based on the information that Allen leaked, Robbins and Bennett collectively spent tens of thousands of dollars acquiring call options in the companies.? They made more than $2.6 million in illicit profits following public announcements of the deals, and Robbins used a portion of his proceeds to fund the independent film production business that he shared with Bennett.      The SEC alleges that Allen communicated with Bennett about the Millennium and Sepracor transactions through phone calls or in-person meetings, some of which were tracked through their simultaneous use of Metrocards at subway stations in New York City as well as large ATM and bank cash withdrawals made by Bennett prior to the meetings. ?Allen first obtained non-public information about the Millennium transaction in mid-February 2008 when his firm began advising Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Company during its negotiations with Millennium. ?On February 27, Allen tipped Bennett with inside information about Takeda?s impending cash tender offer, and Bennett then tipped Robbins. ?Starting on February 29 and continuing up until the week before the public announcement of the acquisition, Robbins and Bennett spent tens of thousands of dollars amassing Millennium call options.? Additionally, Robbins purchased Millennium shares and sold Millennium put options.? After the deal was publicly announced on April 10, the price of Millennium shares increased more than 48 percent, and that afternoon Robbins began liquidating his holdings of Millennium securities for ill-gotten gains of more than $1.12 million.? Bennett liquidated his Millennium holdings for illicit profits of more $602,000.      The SEC further alleges that in May 2009, Allen participated in due diligence work for the Japanese firm Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd. (DSP) in connection with its impending acquisition of Sepracor. ?Allen again tipped Bennett with inside information about the upcoming transaction, and Bennett again shared the information with Robbins. ?In the months leading up to the September 3 public announcement that DSP had agreed to acquire Sepracor, Robbins and Bennett purchased more than $350,000 worth of call options in Sepracor.? Additionally, they sold tens of thousands of dollars of Sepracor put options, and Robbins purchased Sepracor shares. ?Following the public announcement, Sepracor's stock price rose more than 26 percent, and both Robbins and Bennett liquidated their entire positions in Sepracor for ill-gotten profits of more than $388,000 and $516,000 respectively.      The SEC?s complaint charges Robbins with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3.? Robbins has agreed to pay $865,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $150,000 penalty.? The settlement, which is subject to court approval, takes into account Robbins?s current financial condition.? Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robbins also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.?

Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS).      ?Konigsberg played a vital role in Madoff?s deception of his oldest and wealthiest clients over many years,? said Andrew M.

Konigsberg provided tax or accounting services for more than 200 BMIS client accounts, including five of Madoff?s wealthiest and oldest clients who invested more than a billion dollars combined in BMIS.? Konigsberg received fees directly from BMIS clients for the accounting services that he provided them, and BMIS and Madoff paid him a monthly fee of $15,000 or $20,000 as a ?retainer? for providing accounting services to a wealthy and longtime Madoff client and his adult children.      The SEC alleges that Konigsberg coordinated with BMIS staff to: ?

The SEC also charged the underwriter and outside developer of the project and three individuals involved in the offering.      The Greater Wenatchee Regional Events Center Public Facilities District agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying a $20,000 penalty and undertaking remedial actions.? It is the first time that the SEC has assessed a financial penalty against a municipal issuer.?      The issuer is a municipal corporation formed by nine Washington cities and counties in 2006 to fund the Town Toyota Center, located in the city of Wenatchee.? An SEC investigation found inaccuracies in the primary disclosure document accompanying the issuer?s offering of bond anticipation notes in 2008.? The document, called the ?official statement,? stated there had been no independent reviews of the financial projections for the events center.? However, an independent consultant twice examined the projections and raised questions about the center?s economic viability.? The official statement failed to disclose that financial projections had been revised upward based in part upon optimistic assurances by civic leaders that the community would support the project.? The document also omitted key information about the possibility that the City of Wenatchee?s remaining debt capacity of $19.3 million would limit its ability to support any future long-term bonds.      ?Financial penalties against municipal issuers are appropriate for sanctioning and deterring misconduct when, as here, they can be paid from operating funds without directly impacting taxpayers,? said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?This municipal issuer is paying an appropriate price for withholding negative information from its primary offering document and giving investors a false picture of the future performance of the project.?

Global Entertainment and Kozuback each agreed to pay penalties of $10,000.? Williams consented to a cease-and-desist order and the issuer agreed to remedial actions, including training for personnel involved in the offering and disclosure process.?

Martin, who had left Carter?s and started his own consulting firm, maintained contact with at least one company insider and obtained confidential information in advance of market-moving events that he supplied to Megalli so he could trade on it.? Megalli enabled hedge fund Level Global Investors L.P. to avoid approximately $2.4 million in losses and make $853,655 in illicit profits by trading shares ahead of positive or negative news.      ?The information was hot enough that Megalli sometimes conducted the trades while he was still on the phone with his source,? said William Hicks, associate regional director of the SEC?s Atlanta Regional Office.? ?After one profitable trade, Megalli bragged to his colleagues about being ?max short? in advance of negative news without mentioning his inside source.?      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced a criminal case against Megalli.      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Megalli joined Level Global as head of its consumer sector in August 2009 and entered into the consulting agreement with Martin?s firm a month later.? Martin began providing Megalli with confidential information about Carter?s anticipated financial results on the same day the consulting agreement was executed, and Megalli began directing and causing Level Global to trade on that nonpublic information.      The SEC?s complaint alleges that Megalli directed the purchase of 350,000 shares of Carter?s stock from September 14 to 17 based on explicit positive earnings information that he received from Martin.? Megalli?s very first trade in Carter?s shares occurred while he was on the phone with Martin.? On October 23, Martin advised Megalli about an unexpected accounting issue that was uncovered at Carter?s. ?While still on the phone with Martin, Megalli immediately ordered the sale of 100,000 shares and instructed Level Global?s trader to continue selling the firm?s entire position in Carter?s.? After Level Global sold its entire position, Carter?s announced on October 27 that it was delaying its earnings release to complete a review of its accounting.? By selling shares prior to the negative announcement, Level Global avoided losses of more than $2.1 million.      The SEC alleges that Megalli also traded ahead of negative news based on nonpublic information from Martin to avoid losses of $268,500 in November 2009.? Megalli?s trading earned illicit profits of $205,000 in December 2009.? During a telephone conversation on July 8, 2010, Martin tipped Megalli that Carter?s earnings for the quarter would be below expectations. ?Megalli immediately caused Level Global to begin accumulating a short position in Carter?s, and built up the short position to 300,000 shares by July 19.? Carter?s issued an earnings release on July 29 that contained negative future guidance, and its stock subsequently declined in price.? Level Global covered its entire short position at the lower price, generating profits of $648,655.? After the trading, Megalli boasted to colleagues in instant messages about the ?max short? on Carter?s before the negative announcement.? He received hearty congratulations from his colleagues.

793,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Merrill Lynch with making faulty disclosures about collateral selection for two collateralized debt obligations (CDO) that it structured and marketed to investors, and maintaining inaccurate books and records for a third CDO.      Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $131.8 million to settle the SEC?s charges.      The SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings finds that Merrill Lynch failed to inform investors that hedge fund firm Magnetar Capital LLC had a third-party role and exercised significant influence over the selection of collateral for the CDOs entitled Octans I CDO Ltd. and Norma CDO I Ltd.? Magnetar bought the equity in the CDOs and its interests were not necessarily aligned with those of other investors because it hedged its equity positions by shorting against the CDOs.      ?Merrill Lynch marketed complex CDO investments using misleading materials that portrayed an independent process for collateral selection that was in the best interests of long-term debt investors,? said George S. Canellos, co-director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Investors did not have the benefit of knowing that a prominent hedge fund firm with its own interests was heavily involved behind the scenes in selecting the underlying portfolios.?      According to the SEC?s order, Merrill Lynch engaged in the misconduct in 2006 and 2007, when its CDO group was a leading arranger of structured product CDOs.? After four Merrill Lynch representatives met with a Magnetar representative in May 2006, an internal email explained the arrangement as ?we pick mutually agreeable [collateral] managers to work with, Magnetar plays a significant role in the structure and composition of the portfolio ... and in return [Magnetar] retain[s] the equity class and we distribute the debt.? ?The email noted they agreed in principle to do a series of deals with largely synthetic collateral and a short list of collateral managers.? The equity piece of a CDO transaction is typically the hardest to sell and the greatest impediment to closing a CDO. ?Magnetar?s willingness to buy the equity in a series of CDOs therefore gave the firm substantial leverage to influence portfolio composition.      According to the SEC?s order, Magnetar had a contractual right to object to the inclusion of collateral in the Octans I CDO selected by the supposedly independent collateral manager Harding Advisory LLC during the warehouse phase that precedes the closing of a CDO. ?Merrill Lynch, Harding, and Magnetar had finalized a tri-party warehouse agreement that was sent to outside counsel, yet the disclosure that Merrill Lynch provided to investors incorrectly stated that the warehouse agreement was only between Merrill Lynch and Harding.? The SEC has charged Harding and its owner with fraud for accommodating trades requested by Magnetar despite its interests not necessarily aligning with the debt investors. ?      The SEC?s order finds that one-third of the assets for the portfolio underlying the Norma CDO were acquired during the warehouse phase by Magnetar rather than by the designated collateral manager NIR Capital Management LLC.? NIR initially was unaware of Magnetar?s purchases, but eventually accepted them and allowed Magnetar to exercise approval rights over certain other assets for the Norma CDO.? The disclosure that Merrill Lynch provided to investors incorrectly stated that the collateral would consist of a portfolio selected by NIR.? Merrill Lynch also failed to disclose in marketing materials that the CDO gave Magnetar a $35.5 million discount on its equity investment and separately made a $4.5 million payment to the firm that was referred to as a ?sourcing fee.?? The SEC also today announced charges against two managing partners of NIR.      According to the SEC?s order, Merrill Lynch violated books-and-records requirements in another CDO called Auriga CDO Ltd., which was managed by one of its affiliates.? As it did in the Octans I and Norma CDO deals, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay Magnetar interest or returns accumulated on the warehoused assets of the Auriga CDO, a type of payment known as ?carry.?? To benefit itself, however, Merrill Lynch improperly avoided recording many of the warehoused trades at the time they occurred, and delayed recording those trades.? Therefore, Merrill Lynch?s obligation to pay carry was delayed until after the pricing of the Auriga CDO when it became reasonably clear that the trades would be included in the portfolio.      ?Keeping adequate books and records is not an elective requirement of the federal securities laws, and broker-dealers who fail to properly record transactions will be held accountable for their violations,? said Andrew M.

794,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the managing partners of a Charlotte, N.C.-based investment advisory firm for compromising their independent judgment and allowing a third party with its own interests to influence the portfolio selection process of a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) being offered to investors.      The investment managers have agreed to collectively pay more than $472,000 and exit the securities industry to settle the SEC?s charges.      According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, disclosures to investors indicated that NIR Capital Management LLC was solely selecting the assets for Norma CDO I Ltd. as the designated collateral manager.? However, NIR?s Scott H. Shannon accepted assets chosen by hedge fund firm Magnetar Capital LLC for the Norma CDO?s portfolio, and Joseph G. Parish III allowed Magnetar to influence the selection of some other assets.? Shannon himself called at least one of the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) ultimately included in the portfolio a ?real stinker.?? Magnetar bought the equity in the CDO but also placed short bets on collateral in the CDO and therefore had an interest not necessarily aligned with potential long-term debt investors that relied on the CDO and its collateral to perform well.?      The SEC also today announced charges against Merrill Lynch, which structured and marketed the Norma CDO.?      ?Shannon and Parish could not serve two masters,? said George S. Canellos, co-director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?They allowed Magnetar to influence asset selection and abdicated their duty to pick only the assets they believed were best for their client.??      According to the SEC?s order, NIR initially was unaware when Magnatar purchased $472.5 million in long exposure to RMBS for the Norma CDO in August and September 2006 based on information that NIR provided to Magnetar that was preliminary and not intended as a basis for actual collateral selection.? By the time it learned about the purchases in November 2006, NIR already had purchased a substantial portion of the RMBS collateral.? Nevertheless, NIR used its own internal credit metrics to analyze the collateral that Magnetar purchased, and Shannon then sought to exclude some of the RMBS collateral that Magnetar had acquired and selected.? NIR, however, ultimately incorporated the collateral that Magnetar purchased in the closing portfolio.? Shannon explained to an NIR credit analyst that the final portfolio included a number of trades that NIR did not execute, and ?this leaves us with several names we probably would not want...??    According to the SEC?s order, Parish allowed Magnetar to exercise so-called approval rights by permitting the firm to be involved in the process of selecting CDO assets acquired for the portfolio.? As a result, Parish knew that Magnetar was the short counterparty for much of the Norma CDO?s synthetic exposure to CDO securities.? NIR attested in the collateral management agreement with the Norma CDO that it would act in good faith and exercise reasonable care in selecting the portfolio.? However, the CDO and its debt investors knew nothing about NIR?s compromised decision-making with Magnetar involved in the collateral selection process.      Shannon and Parish consented to the SEC?s order finding that Shannon violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Parish violated Section 206(2).? Shannon agreed to be barred from the securities industry for at least two years and must pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $140,662 and a penalty of $116,553.? Parish agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for at least 12 months and must pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $140,662 and a penalty of $75,000.?

795,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against three brokerage subsidiaries and two former employees of a global trading services provider that caused many institutional clients to pay substantially higher amounts than disclosed for the execution of trading orders.?      These subsidiaries of ConvergEx Group agreed to pay more than $107 million and admit wrongdoing to settle the SEC?s charges.? The former employees, Jonathan Daspin and Thomas Lekargeren, also agreed to admit and settle the charges against them.      In a parallel action, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against ConvergEx Group, a brokerage subsidiary, and the two former employees.? To resolve those charges, ConvergEx Group has agreed to pay $43.8 million in criminal penalties and restitution.      Customers with large orders typically rely on their brokers to execute orders on their behalf at the most favorable terms reasonably available.? Monitoring the execution quality and costs of these orders can be difficult even for the most sophisticated investors given the complex nature of the markets where brokers must choose from a variety of order types, routing strategies, and trading venues.      ?Customers have a right to expect honesty from their brokers and accurate information in response to their inquiries,? said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?These ConvergEx brokers misled their customers and failed to provide complete information about the costs they were charging.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, the ConvergEx brokerage firms represented to customers that they charge explicit commissions to execute equity trading orders.? However, they routinely routed orders, including orders for U.S. equities, to an offshore affiliate in Bermuda that executed them on a riskless basis and opportunistically boosted their profits by adding a mark-up or mark-down on the price of a security.? The offshore affiliate often consulted with the client-facing brokers to assess the risk of customer detection before taking the extra money on top of the disclosed commissions. ?The mark-ups and mark-downs caused many customers to unknowingly pay more than double what they understood they were paying to have their orders executed.?      ?ConvergEx brokerages sent customer trades on an unnecessary journey through its offshore affiliate so they could take extra fees behind customers? backs,? said Stephen L. Cohen, associate director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ??Brokers who seek to enhance their bottom lines through deception about their compensation are violating the law and the trust of their customers.?      According to the SEC?s order, the ConvergEx brokerages involved in the scheme were G-Trade Services LLC, ConvergEx Global Markets Limited, and ConvergEx Execution Solutions LLC.? Their customers included funds managed on behalf of charities, religious organizations, retirement plans, universities, and governments.? The ConvergEx brokerages believed they would lose business if customers became aware of their mark-ups and mark-downs, so they engaged in specific acts to hide the scheme.? Typically, they only took mark-ups and mark-downs on top of the disclosed commissions in situations where they believed that the risk of detection was low.? They also made false and misleading statements to customers who inquired about their overall compensation, even providing certain customers with falsified trading data to cover up the fact that the offshore affiliate had taken mark-ups or mark-downs on their orders.? The practice of executing orders through the offshore affiliate was not adequately disclosed to customers and was inconsistent with ConvergEx?s advertised conflict-free agency model.? Using this practice, the ConvergEx brokers failed to seek best execution for their customers? orders.      The SEC?s order finds that the ConvergEx brokerages violated Sections 10(b) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.? The ConvergEx brokerages admitted to the facts underlying the SEC?s charges and acknowledged that their conduct violated the federal securities laws.? The firms agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $87,424,429 and a penalty of $20 million.? In determining the penalty amount, the SEC considered ConvergEx?s substantial cooperation after the agency commenced its investigation.? The SEC also considered the company?s significant remedial measures, including the closure of the Bermuda affiliate and the discharge of a number of employees in management and other positions as it ended the practice of routing U.S. securities offshore for order handling.      Daspin and Lekargeren, who are providing cooperation in the SEC?s investigation, admitted to taking steps to conceal the practice of taking trading profits from customers.? Daspin agreed to pay a total of $1,111,550 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and Lekargeren agreed to pay a total of $117,042 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.??

The SEC alleges that Brian D. Jorgenson, who lives in Lynwood, Wash., obtained confidential information about upcoming company news through his work in Microsoft?s corporate finance and investments division.? Jorgenson tipped Sean T. Stokke of Seattle in advance of the Microsoft announcements, the most recent occurring in October. ?After Stokke traded on the inside information that Jorgenson provided, the two equally split the illicit profits in their shared brokerage accounts.? They made joint trading decisions with the goal of generating enough profits to create their own hedge fund.      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Western District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Jorgenson and Stokke.      ?Abusing access to Microsoft?s confidential information and generating unlawful trading profits is not a wise or legal business model for starting a hedge fund,? said Daniel M. Hawke, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit and director of the SEC?s Philadelphia Regional Office.? ?We thwarted the misguided plans of Jorgenson and Stokke as they sought to illegally profit at others? expense.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Jorgenson and Stokke made a combined $393,125 in illicit profits in their scheme, which began in April 2012.      The SEC alleges that Stokke first traded in advance of a public announcement that Microsoft intended to invest $300 million in Barnes & Noble?s e-reader business.? Jorgenson learned of the impending transaction after his department became involved in the financing aspects of the deal.? Jorgenson tipped Stokke so he could purchase approximately $14,000 worth of call options on Barnes & Noble common stock.? Following a joint public announcement on April 30, Barnes & Noble?s stock price closed at $20.75 per share, a 51.68 percent increase from the previous day.? Jorgenson and Stokke made nearly $185,000 in ill-gotten trading profits.      The SEC alleges that Stokke later traded in advance of Microsoft?s fourth-quarter earnings announcement in July 2013.? As part of his duties at Microsoft, Jorgenson prepared a written analysis of how the market would react to the negative news that Microsoft?s fourth quarter earnings were more than 11 percent below consensus estimates.? He estimated that Microsoft?s stock price would decline by at least six percent.? Jorgenson tipped this confidential information to Stokke, who purchased almost $50,000 worth of Microsoft options.? After Microsoft?s announcement on July 18, its stock price declined more than 11 percent the next day from $35.44 to $31.40 per share.? Jorgenson and Stokke realized more than $195,000 in illicit profits.      According to the SEC?s complaint, Stokke traded in advance of another Microsoft announcement on Oct. 24, 2013.? Jorgenson was aware that the company would be announcing first quarter 2014 earnings that were more than 14 percent higher than consensus estimates.? Rather than purchase Microsoft securities directly, Jorgenson and Stokke purchased more than $45,000 worth of call options on an exchange-traded fund in which Microsoft comprised more than eight percent of the fund?s holdings.? Following the announcement, Microsoft?s share price increased nearly six percent and the price of the ETF increased 0.51 percent.? Jorgenson and Stokke made approximately $13,000 in illegal trading profits.

797,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).      An SEC investigation found that ADM?s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds.? The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses.? ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries.      ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC?s charges.? In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines.?      ?ADM?s lackluster anti-bribery controls enabled its subsidiaries to get preferential refund treatment by paying off foreign government officials,? said Gerald Hodgkins, an associate director in the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Companies with worldwide operations must ensure their compliance is vigilant across the globe and their transactions are recorded truthfully.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008.? Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country.? If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods.? However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all.? On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM?s Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million.      The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM?s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money.? The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds.? For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials.? In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials.? The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine.      The SEC?s complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.? ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354.? The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period.? The settlement is subject to court approval.? The SEC took into account ADM?s cooperation and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct.?

798,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged San Francisco-based snack foods company Diamond Foods and its former CFO in an accounting scheme to falsify walnut costs in order to boost earnings and meet estimates by stock analysts. ?The SEC also charged Diamond?s former CEO for his role in the company?s false financial statements filed with the SEC.    The SEC alleges that Diamond?s then-chief financial officer Steven Neil directed the effort to fraudulently underreport money paid to walnut growers by delaying the recording of payments into later fiscal periods.? In internal e-mails, Neil referred to these commodity costs as a ?lever? to manage earnings in Diamond?s financial statements.? By manipulating walnut costs, Diamond correspondingly reported higher net income and inflated earnings to exceed analysts? estimates for fiscal quarters in 2010 and 2011.? After Diamond restated its financial results in November 2012 to reflect the true costs of acquiring walnuts, the company?s stock price slid to just $17 per share from a high of $90 per share in 2011.    Diamond Foods agreed to pay $5 million to settle the SEC?s charges.? Former CEO Michael Mendes, who should have known that Diamond?s reported walnut cost was incorrect at the time he certified the company?s financial statements, also agreed to settle charges against him.? The SEC?s litigation continues against Neil.    ?Diamond Foods misled investors on Main Street to believe that the company was consistently beating earnings estimates on Wall Street,? said Jina L. Choi, director of the SEC?s San Francisco Regional Office.? ?Corporate officers cannot manipulate fiscal numbers to create a false impression of consistent earnings growth.??    According to the SEC?s complaints filed in federal court in San Francisco, one of the company?s significant lines of business involves buying walnuts from its growers and selling the walnuts to retailers.? With sharp increases in walnut prices in 2010, Diamond encountered a situation where it needed to pay more to its growers in order to maintain longstanding relationships with them.? Yet Diamond could not increase the amounts paid to growers for walnuts, which was its largest commodity cost, without also decreasing the net income that Diamond reports to the investing public.? And Neil was facing pressure to meet or exceed the earnings estimates of Wall Street stock analysts.    The SEC alleges that while faced with competing demands, Neil orchestrated a scheme to have it both ways.? He devised two special payments to please Diamond?s walnut growers and bring the total yearly amounts paid to growers closer to market prices, but improperly excluded portions of those payments from year-end financial statements.? Instead of correctly recording the costs on Diamond?s books, Neil instructed his finance team to consider the payments as advances on crops that had not yet been delivered.? By disguising the reality that the payments were related to prior crop deliveries, Diamond was able to manipulate walnut costs in its accounting to hit quarterly targets for earnings per share (EPS) and exceed estimates by analysts.? For instance, after adjusting the walnut cost in order to meet an EPS target for the second quarter of 2010, Diamond went on to tout its record of ?Twelve Consecutive Quarters of Outperformance? in its reported EPS results during investor presentations.    The SEC further alleges that Neil misled Diamond?s independent auditors by giving false and incomplete information to justify the unusual accounting treatment for the payments.? Neil personally benefited from the fraud by receiving cash bonuses and other compensation based on Diamond?s reported EPS in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.?    The SEC?s order against Mendes finds that he should have known that Diamond?s reported walnut cost was incorrect because of information he received at the time, and he omitted facts in certain representations to Diamond?s outside auditors about the special walnut payments.? Mendes agreed to pay a $125,000 penalty to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations.? Mendes already has returned or forfeited more than $4 million in bonuses and other benefits he received during the time of the company?s fraudulent financial reporting.    The SEC?s complaints against Diamond and Neil allege that they violated or caused violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as Sections 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.? Diamond agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations.? The Commission took into account Diamond?s cooperation with the SEC?s investigation and its remedial efforts once the fraud came to light.? The penalties collected from Diamond and Mendes may be distributed to harmed investors if SEC staff determines that a distribution is feasible.    The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Jennifer J.

An SEC investigation found that more than $110 million in corrupt payments were made to Bahraini officials with influence over contract negotiations between Alcoa and a major government-operated aluminum plant.? Alcoa?s subsidiaries used a London-based consultant with connections to Bahrain?s royal family as an intermediary to negotiate with government officials and funnel the illicit payments to retain Alcoa?s business as a supplier to the plant.? Alcoa lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the bribes, which were improperly recorded in Alcoa?s books and records as legitimate commissions or sales to a distributor.?      Alcoa agreed to settle the SEC?s charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice by paying a total of $384 million.      ?As the beneficiary of a long-running bribery scheme perpetrated by a closely controlled subsidiary, Alcoa is liable and must be held responsible,? said George Canellos, co-director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?It is critical that companies assess their supply chains and determine that their business relationships have legitimate purposes.?      Kara N. Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit added, ?The extractive industries have historically been exposed to a high risk of corruption, and those risks are as real today as when the FCPA was first enacted.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Alcoa is a global provider of not only primary or fabricated aluminum, but also smelter grade alumina ? the raw material that is supplied to plants called smelters that produce aluminum. ?Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite that it extracts in its global mining operations. ?From 1989 to 2009, one of the largest customers of Alcoa?s global bauxite and alumina refining business was Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (Alba), which is considered one of the largest aluminum smelters in the world.? Alba is controlled by Bahrain?s government, and Alcoa?s mining operations in Australia were the source of the alumina that Alcoa supplied to Alba.      According to the SEC?s order, Alcoa?s Australian subsidiary retained a consultant to assist in negotiations for long-term alumina supply agreements with Alba and Bahraini government officials.? A manager at the subsidiary described the consultant as ?well versed in the normal ways of Middle East business? and one who ?will keep the various stakeholders in the Alba smelter happy??? Despite the red flags inherent in this arrangement, Alcoa?s subsidiary inserted the intermediary into the Alba sales supply chain, and the consultant generated the funds needed to pay bribes to Bahraini officials. ?Money used for the bribes came from the commissions that Alcoa?s subsidiary paid to the consultant as well as price markups the consultant made between the purchase price of the product from Alcoa and the sale price to Alba.?      The SEC?s order finds that Alcoa did not conduct due diligence or otherwise seek to determine whether there was a legitimate business purpose for the use of a middleman.? Recipients of the corrupt payments included senior Bahraini government officials, members of Alba?s board of directors, and Alba senior management. ?For example, after Alcoa?s subsidiary retained the consultant to lobby a Bahraini government official, the consultant?s shell companies made two payments totaling $7 million in August 2003 for the benefit of the official. ?Two weeks later, Alcoa and Alba signed an agreement in principle to have Alcoa participate in Alba?s plant expansion.? In October 2004, the consultant?s shell company paid $1 million to an account for the benefit of that same government official, and Alba went on to reach another supply agreement in principle with Alcoa.? Around the time that agreement was executed, the consultant?s companies made three payments totaling $41 million to benefit another Bahraini government official as well.

An SEC investigation found that KPMG broke auditor independence rules by providing prohibited non-audit services such as bookkeeping and expert services to affiliates of companies whose books they were auditing.? Some KPMG personnel also owned stock in companies or affiliates of companies that were KPMG audit clients, further violating auditor independence rules. ? KPMG agreed to pay $8.2 million to settle the SEC?s charges. ? ?Auditors are vital to the integrity of financial reporting, and the mere appearance that they may be conflicted in exercising independent judgment can undermine public confidence in our markets,? said John T.

According to the SEC?s order, KPMG provided various non-audit services ? including restructuring, corporate finance, and expert services ? to an affiliate of one company that was an audit client.? KPMG provided such prohibited non-audit services as bookkeeping and payroll to affiliates of another audit client.? In a separate instance, KPMG hired an individual who had recently retired from a senior position at an affiliate of an audit client.? KPMG then loaned him back to that affiliate to do the same work he had done as an employee of that affiliate, which resulted in the professional acting as a manager, employee, and advocate for the audit client.?

KPMG will engage an independent consultant to evaluate such changes. ?

While the SEC did not bring an enforcement action against KPMG on this basis, it has issued a report of investigation noting that by their very nature, so-called ?loaned staff arrangements? between auditors and audit clients appear inconsistent with Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, which prohibits auditors from acting as employees of their audit clients. ? The report also emphasized: ?  An auditor may not provide otherwise permissible non-audit services (such as permissible tax services) to an audit client in a manner that is inconsistent with other provisions of the independence rules. An arrangement that results in an auditor acting as an employee of the audit client implicates Rule 2-01 regardless of whether the accountant also acts as an officer or director, or performs any decision-making, supervisory, or ongoing monitoring functions, for the audit client.? Audit firms and audit committees must carefully consider whether any proposed service may cause the auditors to resemble employees of the audit client in function or appearance even on a temporary basis.  ?

According to the SEC?s order, Grimaldi is majority owner, president, and chief compliance officer at NMM, which is based in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. ?Grimaldi particularly used a newsletter called The Money Navigator to solicit clients for NMM and investors for the Sector Rotation Fund.? The Money Navigator had more than 60,000 subscribers.? In 2008, the SEC conducted an examination of NMM and a fund it managed.? SEC exam staff notified NMM that the newsletters could be considered advertisements under Rule 206(4)-1, which generally prohibits false or misleading advertisements by investment advisers.? SEC staff also noted that the newsletters could be considered advertisements under Rule 482, which governs advertisements for mutual funds and other investment companies and has specific requirements for ads containing performance data.      The SEC?s order details several misleading advertisements made by NMM and Grimaldi in newsletters following that SEC examination.? For example, they misleadingly claimed in a December 2011 newsletter that Sector Rotation Fund was ?ranked number 1 out of 375 World Allocation funds tracked by Morningstar.?? However, a time period of Oct. 13, 2010 to Oct. 12, 2011 was cherry-picked to broadly acclaim that ranking, and Sector Rotation Fund had a poorer relative performance during other time periods.? From Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, 2011, the day before Grimaldi published the ad, at least 100 other mutual funds in that same Morningstar category outperformed Sector Rotation Fund.      According to the SEC?s order, NMM was advertised as a ?five-star (Morningstar) money manager? in the newsletters as well as on websites and in e-mail correspondence with potential investors.? This claim was materially misleading because Morningstar rates mutual funds not investment advisers.? And since February 2009, NMM has not been the investment manager of any mutual fund rated five stars by Morningstar. ?      The SEC?s order finds that Grimaldi also made misleading statements on Twitter.? He claimed responsibility for model portfolios in his newsletters that ?doubled the S&P 500 the last 10 years.?? However, Grimaldi made the claim even though he had no involvement in the model portfolio performance for the first three years.?      The SEC?s order finds that NMM violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-1(a)(2), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8 as well as Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.? Grimaldi violated many of the same provisions and aided and abetted and caused NMM?s violations.? ??      Grimaldi agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000, and he and the firm agreed to be censured and comply with certain undertakings including the retention of an independent compliance consultant for three years. ?Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, NMM and Grimaldi are required to cease and desist from future violations of these sections of the securities laws.?

804,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged five executives and finance professionals with facilitating a $150 million fraudulent bond offering by Dewey & LeBoeuf, the international law firm where they worked. ? The SEC alleges that the five turned to accounting fraud when the firm needed money to weather the economic recession and steep costs from a merger. ?Fearful that declining revenue might cause its bank lenders to cut off access to the firm?s credit lines, Dewey & LeBoeuf?s leading financial professionals combed through its financial statements line by line and devised ways to artificially inflate income and distort financial performance.? Dewey & LeBoeuf then resorted to the bond markets to raise significant amounts of cash through a private offering that seized on the phony financial numbers. ? ?Investors were led to believe they were purchasing bonds issued by a prestigious law firm that had weathered the financial crisis and was poised for growth,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Dewey & LeBoeuf?s senior-most finance personnel used a grab bag of accounting gimmicks to create that illusion, and top executives green-lighted the decision to sell $150 million in bonds to investors as a desperate grasp for cash on the basis of blatantly falsified financial results.?? ? The SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan charges the following executives at Dewey & LeBoeuf, which is no longer in business: chairman Steven Davis, executive director Stephen DiCarmine, chief financial officer Joel Sanders, finance director Frank Canellas, and controller Tom Mullikin. ? In a parallel action, the Manhattan District Attorney?s Office today announced criminal charges against Davis, DiCarmine, and Sanders. ? According to the SEC?s complaint, the roots of the fraud date back to late 2008 when senior financial officers began to conjure up fake revenue by manipulating various entries in Dewey & LeBoeuf?s internal accounting system.? The firm?s profitability was inflated by approximately $36 million (15 percent) in its 2008 financial results through this use of accounting tricks.? For example, compensation for certain personnel was falsely reclassified as an equity distribution in the amount of $13.8 million when they in fact those personnel had no equity in the firm.? The improper accounting also reversed millions of dollars of uncollectible disbursements, mischaracterized millions of dollars of credit card debt owed by the firm as bogus disbursements owed by clients, and inaccurately accounted for significant lease obligations held by the firm.?? ? The SEC alleges that?? Dewey & LeBoeuf finance executives continued using these and other fraudulent techniques to prepare its 2009 financial statements, which were misstated by $23 million. ?The culture of accounting fraud was so prevalent at the firm that Canellas sent Sanders an e-mail with a schedule containing a list of suggested cost savings to the budget.? Among them was a $7.5 million line item reduction entitled ?Accounting Tricks.? ? According to the SEC?s complaint, Sanders acknowledged in separate e-mail communications, ?I don?t want to cook the books anymore. We need to stop doing that.? ?But he and other finance personnel continued to banter about ways to create fake income.? For example, in the midst of a mad scramble at year-end 2008 to meet obligations to bank lenders, Sanders boasted to DiCarmine in an e-mail, ?We came up with a big one: Reclass the disbursements.?? DiCarmine responded, ?You always do in the last hours. That?s why we get the extra 10 or 20% bonus. Tell [Sanders? wife], stick with me! We?ll buy a ski house next.?? DiCarmine later e-mailed Sanders, ?You certainly cheered the Chairman up. I could use a dose.?? Sanders answered, ?I think we made the covenants and I?m shooting for 60%.? ?He cryptically added, ?Don?t even ask ? you don?t want to know.? ? The SEC alleges that Dewey & LeBoeuf didn?t want investors in the bond offering to know either.? The firm continued using and concealing improper accounting practices well after the offering closed in April 2010. ?The note purchase agreement governing the bond offering required Dewey & LeBoeuf to provide investors and lenders with quarterly certifications. ?The quarterly certifications made by the firm were all fraudulent. ? ?As Dewey & LeBoeuf?s revenue was falling and the firm was struggling to meet commitments, its top executives and finance professionals brazenly looked for ways to create fake income and retain their lucrative salaries and bonuses,? said Andrew M.

807,"View Chart of Trading Profits (pdf, 123 kb)  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stockbroker and a managing clerk at a law firm with insider trading around more than a dozen mergers or other corporate transactions for illicit profits of $5.6 million during a four-year period. The SEC alleges that Vladimir Eydelman and Steven Metro were linked through a mutual friend who acted as a middleman in the illegal trading scheme.? Metro, who works at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York, obtained material nonpublic information about corporate clients involved in pending deals by accessing confidential documents in the law firm?s computer system.? Metro typically tipped the middleman during in-person meetings at a New York City coffee shop, and the middleman later met Eydelman, who was his stockbroker, near the clock and information booth in Grand Central Terminal.? The middleman tipped Eydelman, who was a registered representative at Oppenheimer and is now at Morgan Stanley, by showing him a post-it note or napkin with the relevant ticker symbol.? After the middleman chewed up and sometimes even ate the note or napkin, Eydelman went on to use the illicit tip to illegally trade on his own behalf as well as for family members, the middleman, and other customers.? The middleman allocated a portion of his profits for eventual payment back to Metro in exchange for the inside information.? Metro also personally traded in advance of at least two deals. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Metro, who lives in Katonah, N.Y., and Eydelman, who lives in Colts Neck, N.J.?? ?Law firms are sanctuaries for the confidential treatment of client information, and this scheme victimized not only a law firm but also its corporate clients and ultimately the investors in those companies,? said Daniel M. Hawke, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit. ??We are continuing to combat serial insider trading schemes, particularly by law firm employees and other professionals who are entrusted with extremely sensitive market-moving information.? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the insider trading scheme began in early February 2009 at a bar in New York City when Metro met the middleman and other friends for drinks.? When Metro and the middleman separated from the rest of their friends and began discussing stocks, the middleman expressed concern about his holdings in Sirius XM Radio and his fear that the company may go bankrupt.? Metro divulged that Liberty Media Corp. planned to invest more than $500 million in Sirius, and said he obtained this information by viewing documents at the law firm where he worked.? As a result, the middleman later called Eydelman and told him to buy additional shares of Sirius.? Eydelman expressed similar concern about Sirius? struggling stock, but the middleman assured him that his reliable source was a friend who worked at a law firm.? Following the public announcement of the deal, whose news coverage noted that Simpson Thacher acted as legal counsel to Sirius, Eydelman acknowledged to the middleman, ?Nice trade.?? The middleman told Metro following the announcement that he had set aside approximately $7,000 for Metro as a ?thank you? for the information.? Instead of taking the money, Metro told the middleman to leave it in his brokerage account and invest it on Metro?s behalf based on confidential information that he planned to pass him in the future.? According to the SEC?s complaint, Metro tipped and Eydelman traded on inside information about 12 more companies as they settled into a routine to cloak their illegal activities.? Metro shared confidential nonpublic information with the middleman by typing on his cell phone screen the names or ticker symbols of the two companies involved in the transaction.? Metro pointed to the names or ticker symbols to indicate which company was the acquirer and which was being acquired.? Metro also conveyed the approximate price of the transaction and the approximate announcement date.? The middleman then communicated to Eydelman that they should meet.? Once at Grand Central Station, the middleman walked up to Eydelman and showed him the post-it note or napkin containing the ticker symbol of the company whose stock price was likely to increase as a result of the corporate transaction.? Eydelman watched the middleman chew or eat the tip to destroy the evidence.? Eydelman also learned from the middleman an approximate price of the transaction and an approximate announcement date. The SEC alleges that Eydelman then returned to his office and typically gathered research about the target company.? He eventually e-mailed the research to the middleman along with his purported thoughts about why buying the stock made sense. ?The contrived e-mails were intended to create what Eydelman and the middleman believed to be a sufficient paper trail with plausible justification for engaging in the transaction. ?People often try to cover their insider trading tracks by using middlemen, destroying evidence, and creating phony documents.? They should learn that sham cover stories simply don?t work and won?t deter us from finding their schemes,? said Robert A. Cohen, co-deputy chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit.? According to the SEC?s complaint, Eydelman also traded on inside information in the accounts of more than 50 of his brokerage customers.? Eydelman earned substantial commissions as a result of this trading, and received bonuses from his employers based on his performance driven in large part by the profits garnered through the insider trading scheme.? The middleman?s agreement with Metro resulted in more than $168,000 being apportioned to Metro as his share of profits from the insider trading scheme in addition to his profits from personally trading in advance of at least two transactions. The SEC?s complaint charges Metro and Eydelman with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.? The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Metro and Eydelman to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties, and permanent injunctions from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC?s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jason Burt and Carolyn Welshhans in the Market Abuse Unit.?

808,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced two separate cases against men who profited by insider trading on confidential information they learned from their wives about Silicon Valley-based tech companies.?      ?Spouses and other family members may gain access to highly confidential information about public companies as part of their relationship of trust,? said Jina L. Choi, director of the SEC?s San Francisco Regional Office.? ?In those circumstances, family members have a duty to protect and safeguard that information, not to trade on it.???      The SEC alleges that Tyrone Hawk of Los Gatos, Calif., violated a duty of trust by trading after he overheard work calls made by his wife, a finance manager at Oracle Corp., regarding her company?s plan to acquire Acme Packet Inc. ?Hawk also had a conversation with his wife in which she informed him that there was a blackout window for trading Oracle securities because it was in the process of acquiring another company.? According to the SEC?s complaint, Hawk bought Acme Packet shares before the acquisition was announced in February 2013, and reaped approximately $150,000 by selling after the stock price rose 23 percent on the news. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hawk agreed to pay more than $300,000 to settle the SEC?s charges.      In an unrelated case, the SEC alleges that Ching Hwa Chen of San Jose, Calif., profited from gleaning confidential information in mid-2012 that his wife?s employer, Informatica Corp., would miss its quarterly earnings target for the first time in 31 consecutive quarters.? During a drive to vacation in Reno, Nev., Chen overheard business calls by his wife, who previously advised Chen not to trade in Informatica securities under any circumstances.? However, after they returned from Reno, he established securities positions designed to make money if the stock price fell.? Informatica?s shares declined more than 27 percent after it announced the earnings miss, and Chen realized nearly $140,000 in profits. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Chen agreed to pay approximately $280,000 to settle the SEC?s charges.???      The SEC has brought other insider trading cases involving individuals who traded on material, nonpublic information misappropriated from spouses.? For example, last year the SEC charged a Houston man with insider trading ahead of a corporate acquisition based on confidential details that he gleaned from his wife, a partner at a large law firm that was consulted on the deal.? In 2011, the SEC charged an Illinois man who bought the stock of an acquisition target of a company where his wife was an executive despite her requests that he keep the merger information confidential.? In a different 2011 case, the SEC charged the spouse of a CEO with insider trading on confidential information that he misappropriated from her in advance of company news announcements.

809,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two friends with insider trading on confidential information from an investment banker about an impending transaction between engineering and construction companies.      The SEC alleges that Walter D. Wagner of Rockville, Md., and Alexander J. Osborn of Alexandria, Va., illicitly profited by nearly $1 million combined by trading on nonpublic information in advance of the acquisition of The Shaw Group by Chicago Bridge & Iron Company. ?Wagner was tipped by his longtime friend John W. Femenia, who worked at a firm that was considering whether to finance the transaction.? Wagner then tipped Osborn with the inside information so they could each trade heavily in Shaw Group securities ahead of the public announcement on July 30, 2012, when the closing stock price jumped approximately 55 percent from the previous day.?      Wagner has agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by disgorging his ill-gotten gains plus interest.? Any additional financial penalty will be decided by the court at a later date.? A parallel criminal action against Wagner was announced today by the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Western District of North Carolina.      The SEC?s litigation continues against Osborn.? The SEC already charged Femenia in a related insider trading case.? He was subsequently barred from the securities industry.      ?Wagner and Osborn had never bought stock or call options in The Shaw Group, yet they suddenly spent significant portions of their available cash resources to make sizeable purchases in the weeks preceding the public announcement of the acquisition,? said William P. Hicks, associate director for enforcement in the SEC?s Atlanta Regional Office.? ?The SEC is committed to deciphering the stories behind suspicious trades and exposing those who trade on confidential information obtained from corporate insiders.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., all three attended the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.? Wagner and Femenia met in college and remained friends after graduating in 2003.? Osborn, who graduated in 2006, became friends with Wagner around 2009 when they worked in the same office building for different government contractors.? The SEC alleges that Femenia collected nonpublic details about the acquisition while at work and communicated them to Wagner via text messages and phone calls in violation of the duty he owed his firm to keep the information confidential.? Wagner knew Femenia was employed in investment banking at Wells Fargo Securities.? Wagner in turn tipped Osborn, who knew that Wagner?s source was employed in the finance industry.? Wagner and Osborn used the nonpublic information to obtain illegal trading profits of approximately $517,784 and $439,830 respectively.      The SEC?s complaint charges Wagner and Osborn with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. In addition to the financial sanction of $528,175 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, Wagner has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

810,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Hewlett-Packard with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries in three different countries made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.      Hewlett-Packard has agreed to pay more than $108 million to settle the SEC?s charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.      The SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings finds that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based technology company?s subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multi-million dollar contract with the federal prosecutor?s office.? In Poland, Hewlett-Packard?s subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency.? And as part of its bid to win a software sale to Mexico?s state-owned petroleum company, Hewlett-Packard?s subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials.?      ?Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe.? The company?s books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses,? said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit.? ?Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.?      According to the SEC?s order, the scheme involving Hewlett-Packard?s Russian subsidiary occurred from approximately 2000 to 2007.? The bribes were paid through agents and consultants in order to win a government contract for computer hardware and software.? Employees within the subsidiary and elsewhere raised questions about the significant markup being paid to the agent on the deal and the subcontractors that the agent expected to use.? Despite the red flags, the deal went forward without any meaningful due diligence on the agent or the subcontractors.      The SEC?s order finds that bribes involving Hewlett-Packard?s subsidiary in Poland occurred from approximately 2006 to 2010.? Acting primarily through its public sector sales manager, the subsidiary agreed to pay a Polish government official in order to win contracts for information technology products and services.? The official received a percentage of net revenue earned from the contracts, and the bribes were delivered in cash from off-the-books accounts.      According to the SEC?s order, Hewlett-Packard?s subsidiary in Mexico paid a consultant to help the company win a public IT contract worth approximately $6 million.? At least $125,000 was funneled to a government official at the state-owned petroleum company with whom the consultant had connections. ?Although the consultant was not an approved deal partner and had not been subjected to the due diligence required under company policy, HP Mexico sales managers used a pass-through entity to pay inflated commissions to the consultant.? This was internally referred to as the ?influencer fee.?      Hewlett-Packard consented to the SEC?s order, which finds that it violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.? The company agreed to pay $29 million in disgorgement (approximately $26.47 million to the SEC and $2.53 million to satisfy an IRS forfeiture as part of the criminal matter).? Hewlett-Packard also agreed to pay prejudgment interest of $5 million to the SEC and fines totaling $74.2 million in the criminal case for a total of more than $108 million in disgorgement and penalties.???

811,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former biopharmaceutical company executive and two others with insider trading on confidential information about the company?s key developmental drug.? The company?s stock price fell sharply when it announced clinical trial results for the drug.    Dr. Loretta Itri, president of pharmaceutical development and chief medical officer of Genta, Inc., her longtime friend, Dr. Neil Moskowitz, an emergency room physician, and one of his patients, were named in the insider-trading action.? In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, the SEC alleged that Itri obtained material nonpublic information about Genta?s clinical trial results for an experimental drug designed to treat advanced melanoma.? In a telephone conversation just one day before the public announcement of the drug trial results, Itri provided Moskowitz with material nonpublic information.? Minutes after that, Moskowitz sold his Genta securities and tipped a friend and patient, Mathew Cashin, concerning the results.? As a result of their trading based on material nonpublic information, Moskowitz and Cashin reaped approximately $139,000 of illegal gains.    ?Itri was entrusted with highly confidential information by Genta, but betrayed her duty as an executive allowing a friend to profit,? said Amelia A. Cottrell, associate director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.? ?We will continue to hold company insiders responsible and punish this type of betrayal of trust.?    According to the SEC?s complaint, Itri was directly involved in the drug trials at Genta, and was one of the first to learn of the results prior to the public announcement on October 29, 2009. ?Genta?s stock dropped approximately 70 percent on the news, and the SEC alleges that Moskowitz and Cashin obtained illegal gains by selling their Genta stock the day before the announcement.    The SEC?s complaint charges Itri, Moskowitz, and Cashin with violating federal antifraud laws and the SEC?s antifraud rule.? Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the three defendants agreed to settle the SEC?s charges against them.?    The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would enjoin the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws and require Itri to pay civil penalty of approximately $64,000 and bar her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.? The settlement also requires Moskowitz to return $64,300 of allegedly ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest of $9,556, and pay a civil penalty of $64,300.? The settlement requires Cashin to return $75,140 of allegedly ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest of $10,955, and pay a civil penalty of $37,570, which reflects the cooperation Cashin provided to the SEC?s investigation.

812,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an enforcement action against the New York Stock Exchange and two affiliated exchanges for their failure to comply with the responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to conduct their business operations in accordance with Commission-approved exchange rules and the federal securities laws.? Also charged was the NYSE exchanges? affiliated routing broker Archipelago Securities.      The NYSE exchanges agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by retaining an independent consultant and together with Archipelago Securities paying a $4.5 million penalty.?      ?The SEC regulates exchanges, in part, by reviewing rules proposed by the exchanges that govern exchange activities and allow market participants to decide how and where to place orders,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?We will hold exchanges accountable if they fail to have rules governing their operations or fail to follow them.?      As SROs, the NYSE exchanges are required to conduct their operations in accordance and compliance with their own rules as well as the federal securities laws.? They are required to file all proposed rules and rule changes with the Commission, which publishes them for public comment, before they take effect. ?This transparency enables all participants trading on the exchanges to understand how their orders are processed and executed. ?      According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, the NYSE exchanges repeatedly engaged in business practices that either violated exchange rules or required a rule when the exchanges had none in effect. ?For example, all of the NYSE exchanges used an error account maintained at Archipelago Securities to trade out of securities positions taken on as a result of their operations despite not having rules in effect that permitted them to maintain and use such an account.? In another example, NYSE Arca failed to execute a certain type of limit order under specified market conditions despite having a rule in effect that stated that NYSE Arca would execute such orders.      ?The order highlights instances where the exchanges conducted business without a rule in place due to weak or inadequate policies and procedures,? said Antonia Chion, an associate director in the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?In other instances, the exchanges did not operate in compliance with their effective rules.? Both failures reflect a troubling lack of compliance with the requirements and obligations imposed on securities exchanges.??      The violations detailed in the SEC?s order occurred during periods of time from 2008 to 2012.? The SEC?s order finds that the NYSE exchanges violated Section 19(b) and 19(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 through misconduct that included the following:        NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex) used an error account maintained at Archipelago Securities to assume and trade out of securities positions without a rule in effect that permitted such trading and in a manner inconsistent with their rules for the routing broker, which limited Archipelago Securities? activity primarily to outbound and inbound routing of orders on behalf of those exchanges.         NYSE provided co-location services to customers on disparate contractual terms without an exchange rule in effect that permitted and governed the provision of such services on a fair and equitable basis.      NYSE operated a block trading facility (New York Block Exchange) that for a period of time did not function in accordance with the rules submitted by NYSE and approved by the SEC.      NYSE distributed an automated feed of closing order imbalance information to its floor brokers at an earlier time than was specified in NYSE?s rules.         NYSE Arca failed to execute Mid-Point Passive Liquidity Orders (MPLOs) in locked markets (where the bid and ask prices are the same) contrary to its exchange rule in effect at the time.       In addition, the SEC?s order finds that NYSE Arca accepted MPLOs in sub-penny amounts for National Market System stocks trading at over $1.00 per share, in violation of Rule 612(a) of Regulation NMS.      The SEC?s order further finds that Archipelago Securities failed to establish and maintain policies reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information in connection with error account trading.? Archipelago Securities also violated and failed to give the SEC timely notice of its violation of the net capital rule ? a critical federal securities law provision intended to ensure that brokers and dealers remain solvent and can meet their financial obligations.? ?      Now wholly-owned subsidiaries of IntercontinentalExchange Inc., NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT, and Archipelago Securities have consented to the SEC?s order without admitting or denying the findings.? They agreed to collectively pay the penalty of $4.5 million, and the NYSE exchanges agreed to complete significant undertakings including retaining an independent consultant to complete a comprehensive review of their policies and procedures for determining whether (1) a new business practice or a change to an existing business practice requires the filing with the SEC of a proposed rule or rule change, and (2) business practices requiring an exchange rule are conducted pursuant to and in accordance with an effective exchange rule.

In complaints filed in federal court in Miami, the SEC charged five penny stock promoters with conducting various manipulation schemes involving undisclosed payments to induce purchases of a microcap stock to generate the false appearance of market interest. ?The SEC also charged a Massachusetts-based microcap company and the CEO with orchestrating a pair of illicit kickback schemes and an insider trading scheme involving the company?s stock.? A stock promoter in Texas is charged for his role in the insider trading scheme.      ?These stock promoters employed a menu of schemes, tricks, and deceits in their pursuit of unearned money at the expense of other investors,? said Eric I. Bustillo, director of the SEC?s Miami Regional Office.? ?Their bold misconduct highlights the continuing need for law enforcement action to aggressively root out microcap fraud.?

The first of the joint enforcement actions was announced in October 2010.

They generated the appearance of market interest in EIHC to induce investors to purchase the stock and artificially increase the trading price and volume.? In a separate complaint against Jeffrey M.

Brown of Brooklyn, N.Y., alleges that he engaged in a pair of market manipulation schemes involving the stock of International Development & Environmental Holdings Corp. (IDEH) and DAM Holdings Inc. (DAMH), the latter of which is now known as Premier Beverage Group Corp. (PBGC).? And according to an SEC complaint against Boca Raton, Fla.-based stock promoter Richard A.

(AQUM) and its president and CEO Billy V. Ray Jr. of Cumming, Ga., schemed to make an undisclosed kickback payment to a hedge fund manager in exchange for the fund?s purchase of restricted shares of stock in the company.? In a separate kickback scheme, Ray made an inducement payment to a stock promoter who would purchase shares of Urban on the open market ahead of planned press releases to help him manipulate the stock.? Meanwhile, stock promoter Wade Clark participated in Ray?s insider trading scheme involving Urban stock by providing the hedge fund fiduciary with an advance copy of a press release containing material nonpublic information about the company so the hedge fund manager would purchase stock prior to the news being issued.      The SEC?s complaints allege that Altomare, Bauer, Berkowitz, Brown, Clark, McKnight, Ray, and Urban AG Corp. violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and/or Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c).?

New York-based LavaFlow Inc. has agreed to pay $5 million to settle the SEC?s charges, including a $2.85 million penalty that is the agency?s largest to date against an ATS.      An ATS is a venue that executes stock trades on behalf of broker-dealers and other traders.? LavaFlow operates a type of ATS known as an electronic communications network (ECN), which unlike a dark pool displays some information about pending orders in its system, such as best bid or best offer.? Under federal rules, an ATS must have safeguards to protect the confidential trading information of its subscribers.      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, LavaFlow allowed an affiliate operating a technology application known as a smart order router to access and use confidential information related to the non-displayed orders of LavaFlow?s ECN?s subscribers.? The order router was located outside of the ECN?s operations and LavaFlow did not have adequate safeguards and procedures to protect the confidential information that the order router accessed.? While LavaFlow only allowed the affiliate to use the confidential trading data for order router customers who also were ECN subscribers, the firm did not obtain consent from its subscribers to use their confidential information in this way, nor did LavaFlow disclose the use in its regulatory filings with the SEC.??      According to the SEC?s order, LavaFlow eventually discontinued this practice, but not before the smart order router executed more than 400 million shares in a three-year period based in part on the subscriber information contained in the ECN?s unexecuted hidden orders.      ?Operators of alternative trading systems must protect confidential subscriber data and take steps to ensure that affiliates do not improperly use order information,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division. ?We will continue to hold accountable firms that fail to follow the rules applicable to off-exchange venues.?      Daniel M. Hawke, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit, added, ?LavaFlow?s subscribers trusted and expected that knowledge of their hidden orders would not escape the ATS.? Because much of today?s equity trading is automated, firms must protect sensitive information within computer networks just as aggressively as they police against the misuse of information by people.?      Alternative trading systems currently execute approximately 12 percent of the U.S. equity trading volume.? According to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data, LavaFlow is estimated to be a top 10 ATS when measured by share or trade volume.? LavaFlow is owned by Citigroup Financial Products.      In addition to the Regulation ATS violations, the SEC?s order finds that LavaFlow aided and abetted a violation by the same affiliate that operated the smart order router, Lava Trading Inc., which continued to provide broker-dealer services for several months after it deregistered in August 2008.? Lava Trading, which also was owned by Citigroup Financial Products, earned approximately $1.8 million in broker-dealer business during this time period, and LavaFlow provided operational and administrative support while also responsible for a website that claimed Lava Trading was a registered broker-dealer.      The SEC?s order finds that LavaFlow violated Rule 301(b)(10) of Regulation ATS, which requires an ATS to establish safeguards and procedures for protecting confidential trading information of its subscribers.? LavaFlow also violated Rule 301(b)(2) of Regulation ATS, which requires that an ATS file certain amendments on Form ATS with the SEC.? LavaFlow aided and abetted and caused Lava Trading?s violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires broker-dealer registration.? The SEC?s order, to which LavaFlow consented without admitting or denying the findings, requires the firm to pay $1.8 million in disgorgement of money earned by Lava Trading while unregistered plus $350,000 in prejudgment interest and a $2.85 million penalty.? The order also censures LavaFlow and requires the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing these violations.

818,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former chief executive officer of a broker-dealer subsidiary of ConvergEx Group LLC for deceiving brokerage customers with hidden fees to buy and sell securities.?      The SEC?s complaint alleges that the former CEO, Anthony G. Blumberg, engaged in a scheme that entailed concealing the practice of routing orders to an offshore affiliate in Bermuda to add mark-ups or mark-downs.? The hidden fees known as ?trading profits? or ?TP? were in addition to and often much higher than the commissions paid by customers to have their orders executed.?      The charges against Blumberg follow those announced in December by the SEC against three ConvergEx subsidiaries that agreed to pay more than $107 million and admit wrongdoing to settle the matter.? Two former employees also settled charges with the SEC.?      According to the SEC?s complaint filed against Blumberg in federal court in Newark, N.J., one university customer paid about $93,000 in disclosed commissions and about $543,000 in undisclosed TP.? In another case, $1.6 million in fees allegedly went undetected.? The SEC alleges that Blumberg engaged in deceptive practices to conceal the additional fees, and he encouraged traders under his management to do the same.      ?We will continue to hold individuals accountable, including senior officials at broker-dealers, when they engage in fraudulent schemes to mislead customers,? said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.      The U.S. Department of Justice today announced parallel criminal charges against Blumberg.? In the prior parallel criminal proceeding announced in December, ConvergEx Group and its Bermuda broker-dealer agreed to pay $43.8 million, and the two former employees named in the SEC case pleaded guilty in the criminal case.      ConvergEx has since shut down trading operations at the Bermuda broker-dealer subsidiary ConvergEx Global Markets Limited.? Blumberg was CEO of ConvergEx Global Markets Limited and ConvergEx Global Markets, which included a unit of U.S. broker G-Trade Services LLC.      The SEC?s complaint alleges that Blumberg directed employees to suspend the taking of TP when customers were monitoring execution prices.? Blumberg made false and misleading statements to a brokerage customer and authorized employees to falsify trading data for customers who inquired about the details of their securities transactions.      ?During his tenure, Blumberg directed a culture of deception and greed that systematically harmed investors,? said Stephen L. Cohen, an associate director in the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?He had the power to put an end to this fraud, but instead used his power to encourage and perpetuate it.?      The SEC?s complaint alleges that Blumberg violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and an SEC antifraud rule.? The complaint further alleges liability as a control person and aiding and abetting violations by certain ConvergEx subsidiaries and former employees.? The SEC is seeking disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with interest, a financial penalty, and permanent injunctive relief.

819,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Minneapolis-based hedge fund manager, his investment advisory firm, and an accomplice with bilking investors in two hedge funds out of more than $1 million under the guise of research expenses and fees.?      The SEC alleges that as the management fees earned by Archer Advisors LLC were shrinking due to the funds? worsening performance, the firm?s owner Steven R. Markusen and an employee Jay C. Cope implemented a scheme to enrich themselves at the expense of investors in the funds.? Markusen routinely caused the funds to reimburse Archer for fake research expenses, and he eventually routed much of that money to his personal checking account and spent it on country club dues, boarding school tuition, and a Lexus among other luxury items.? Furthermore, Markusen devised a way to essentially charge fund investors twice for the same fake research expenses.? First, he billed the funds directly by falsely claiming that Archer had paid Cope to conduct ?research? for the funds.? Second, he and Cope improperly diverted soft dollars from the hedge funds to Cope for the same purported ?research? under the additional pretense that Cope was an independent consultant.? Soft dollars were supposed to be used to buy third-party investment research that benefited the funds.? Cope conducted no third-party research as an Archer officer whose main duties were placing trades and helping Markusen find new investors.      The SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Minneapolis also charges Markusen and Cope with conducting a separate scheme to manipulate the stock price of the funds? largest holding in order to inflate the monthly returns reported to investors and conceal the true extent of the funds? mounting investment losses.      ?Markusen and his firm had an obligation to manage investor money in the hedge funds fairly and honestly.? Instead, he and Cope exploited their control of the funds to engage in long-running schemes to misappropriate fund assets and artificially pump up the value of the poorly-performing funds,? said Robert J. Burson, Associate Director of the SEC?s Chicago Regional Office.?      According to the SEC?s complaint, the scheme enabled Markusen to secretly pay Cope?s salary with fund soft dollars rather than out of Archer?s coffers.? Markusen and Cope disguised Cope?s $10,000 monthly salary payments as research fees because under the governing documents of the hedge funds they managed and SEC rules, Archer employees could not draw a salary from fund assets or receive fund soft dollars for non-research assistance.? The SEC alleges that Markusen and Cope traded excessively in the funds? brokerage accounts in order to generate enough soft dollars to pay Cope?s monthly salary at Archer.? They misrepresented Cope?s relationship with Archer to the brokerage firms that administered the funds? soft dollars, and created false and misleading monthly ?research? invoices for the amount of Cope?s salary.? Markusen and Cope sent the invoices each month to the funds? brokerage firms, who in turn paid fund soft dollars directly to Cope for the purported research expenses.? Markusen would then receive a $1,000 monthly kickback from Cope.      According to the SEC?s complaint, Markusen and Cope carried out their portfolio pumping scheme by manipulating the price of the thinly-traded stock of CyberOptics Corp. (CYBE), which comprised over 75 percent of the funds? portfolios and was by far the largest holding.? Knowing that Archer?s trading as CYBE?s largest shareholder could materially impact the market price, Markusen and Cope ?marked the close? in CYBE on the last trading day of the month at least 28 times.? In doing so, they sought to improperly drive up CYBE?s closing price by placing multiple buy orders often seconds before the market closed to artificially pump up the value of the funds? portfolios, which were valued as of the close of trading on the month?s last trading day. ?Those valuations were used to calculate the funds? monthly returns that Archer reported to investors as well as Archer?s monthly management fee, which was a fixed percentage of each portfolio?s value.? The higher CYBE closing price at the end of each month enabled Markusen to inflate the funds? performance and extract more lucrative management fees.      The SEC?s complaint charges Archer, Markusen, and Cope with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and certain reporting provisions.      The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Nicholas Eichenseer, Luz Aguilar, and Paul Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office with assistance from Kevin Vincent and Lorraine Ricci of the office?s examination program.?

820,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two individuals managing an offshore business intended to help clients evade U.S. securities laws with concealing the ownership of certain microcap stocks as part of a larger money laundering scheme alleged by criminal authorities.      Under the federal securities laws, beneficial owners of more than 5 percent of certain stocks are required to report their acquisition and ownership of those stocks to the SEC and the investing public.? The SEC alleges that Belize residents Robert Bandfield and Andrew Godfrey through a company called IPC Corporate Services have helped clients who own significant amounts of thinly-traded microcap stocks avoid these reporting requirements.? They created associated companies through which the clients could hide their ownership and spread the shares so that none of them contained more than 5 percent of the stock of any particular microcap issuer.? They stressed to their clients the importance of staying below the 5 percent reporting threshold for each associated entity.? However, because Bandfield and IPC owned the associated entities used in this arrangement, they assumed beneficial ownership of all the clients? shares of these microcap stocks. ?Therefore, IPC and Bandfield were themselves required to report their beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent in each stock.?      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bandfield and Godfrey for violations of other federal laws extending beyond the SEC?s purview.      ?The federal securities laws provide investors the right to know when an individual or entity owns and controls more than 5 percent of a stock because purchases or sales by that major shareholder can have the potential to sway the stock price in one direction or another,? said Michael Paley, Co-Chair of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Microcap Fraud Task Force.? ?Bandfield with Godfrey?s assistance designed an offshore system to deliberately keep the rest of the market from knowing that someone owned significant amounts of particular stocks.? In microcap stock schemes like these that extend even beyond securities laws violations, we will continue to work with criminal authorities to bring wrongdoers to justice for the full extent of their crimes.?      The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related SEC rules require beneficial owners of more than 5 percent of a class of stock of certain companies to file Schedule 13D or 13G.?

821,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 28 officers, directors, or major shareholders for violating federal securities laws requiring them to promptly report information about their holdings and transactions in company stock.? Six publicly-traded companies were charged for contributing to filing failures by insiders or failing to report their insiders? filing delinquencies.      The charges stem from an SEC enforcement initiative focusing on two types of ownership reports that give investors the opportunity to evaluate whether the holdings and transactions of company insiders could be indicative of the company?s future prospects.? Form 4 is a report that corporate officers, directors, and certain beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of a registered class of a company?s stock must use to report their transactions in company stock within two business days.? Schedule 13D and 13G are reports that beneficial owners of more than 5 percent of a registered class of a company?s stock must use to report holdings or intentions with respect to the company.? SEC enforcement staff used quantitative data sources and ranking algorithms to identify these insiders as repeatedly filing late.? Some filings were delayed by weeks, months, or even years.?      A total of 33 of the 34 individuals and companies named in the SEC?s orders agreed to settle the charges and pay financial penalties totaling $2.6 million.      ?Using quantitative analytics, we identified individuals and companies with especially high rates of filing deficiencies, and we are bringing these actions together to send a clear message about the importance of these filing provisions,? said Andrew J.

Those who fail to do so run the risk of facing an SEC enforcement action.?      These reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and under Section 13(d) or (g) of the Exchange Act apply irrespective of profits or a person?s reasons for acquiring holdings or engaging in transactions. ?The failure to timely file a required beneficial ownership report, even if inadvertent, constitutes a violation of these rules.

The federal securities laws require certain corporate executives to report their transactions in the company?s stock in order to give investors the opportunity to evaluate whether the purchases and sales by an insider could be indicative of the prospects of the company.? An SEC investigation found that after Gary H. Rabin became CEO, CFO, and chairman of Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) in 2010, he repeatedly failed to report his sales of company stock for the next few years.? Subsequently, ACT?s annual reports and proxy statements during that period were inaccurate because they failed to report that Rabin was not complying with his obligation to disclose his substantial sales of ACT stock.      ACT and Rabin agreed to settle the SEC?s charges.      ?It?s not merely a technical lapse when executives fail to report their transactions in company stock, because investors are consequently denied important and timely information about how an insider is potentially viewing the company?s future prospects,? said Michele Wein Layne, Director of the SEC?s Los Angeles Regional Office.? ?Instead of reporting his numerous company stock sales within two days as typically required, Rabin waited more than two years and compromised Advanced Cell Technology?s financial reporting obligations.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and underlying SEC rules require officers and directors of a company with a registered class of equity securities to file reports of their securities holdings and transactions.? The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and additional SEC regulations accelerated the reporting deadline for most insider transactions to two business days and mandated that all reports be filed electronically with the SEC to facilitate rapid dissemination to the public.      The SEC?s order finds that Rabin?s sales would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as significantly altering the total mix of available information about ACT given his executive position as well as the size and frequency of his sales of the company?s stock.? However, it wasn?t until May 2013 that Rabin eventually reported his 27 sales of $1.5 million worth of ACT stock from 2010 to 2012.? ACT and Rabin violated the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws by failing to file reports of these transactions and holdings in a timely and accurate manner.? Rabin signed and ACT filed annual reports and proxy statements during this period that were false and misleading due to Rabin?s missing Section 16(a) reports.

823,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based high frequency trading firm with violating the net capital rule that requires all broker-dealers to maintain minimum levels of net liquid assets or net capital.? The firm?s former chief operating officer is charged with causing the extensive violations.      An SEC investigation found that Latour Trading LLC operated without maintaining its required minimum net capital on 19 of 24 reporting dates during a two-year period, and the firm missed the mark by large amounts ranging from $2 million to $28 million. ?During this period, Latour?s trading at times accounted for as much as 9 percent of the trading volume in equity securities for the entire U.S. market. ?      To settle the SEC?s charges, Latour agreed to pay a $16 million penalty, the largest ever for violations of the net capital rule.? The previous high was $400,000 in an enforcement action in 2004.? Nicolas Niquet, Latour?s chief operating officer when the series of violations began, agreed to pay a $150,000 penalty to settle the charges against him.      ?This record sanction reflects the seriousness of Latour?s violations of the net capital rule, which is a critical broker-dealer financial responsibility requirement,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ??We also will aggressively pursue executives who cause the violations.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, a crucial step for a broker-dealer when calculating its net capital is to take percentage deductions referred to as ?haircuts? from the firm?s proprietary securities and other positions.? The purpose of these haircut deductions as prescribed in the net capital rule is to account for the market risk inherent in a firm?s positions and create a buffer of liquidity to protect against other risks associated with the securities business.? A failure to calculate proper haircuts can inflate a broker-dealer?s net capital.      The SEC?s order finds that Latour repeatedly miscalculated its net capital amounts in 2010 and 2011 by failing to make proper haircut deductions from the market value of its proprietary securities positions and other positions.? Latour incorrectly used hypothetical positions that the firm did not actually hold to create hedges and capitalize qualified stock baskets.? Latour also used inaccurate index composition data for certain international exchange-traded funds that the firm traded.? Latour?s combined use of hypothetical positions and inaccurate index composition data resulted in haircuts that were generally far too low when calculating the firm?s net capital.? Latour also failed to calculate minimum capital charges on all of its futures positions, and excluded some positions from taking any haircut at all due to a computer programming error.? Niquet designed the processing code that facilitated Latour?s haircut calculations and caused its net capital violations.      According to the SEC?s order, Latour?s net capital violations also resulted in violations of the books and records and financial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.?      The SEC?s order finds that Latour violated Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 15c3-1, 17a-3(a)(11), 17a-4(f), and 17a-5(a).?

824,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Brooklyn man with facilitating a $5.6 million insider trading scheme that typically involved the passing of illegal tips via napkins or post-it notes at Grand Central Terminal.      Earlier this year, the SEC charged a stockbroker and a law firm managing clerk with insider trading and alleged they were connected by a mutual friend who served as a ?middleman? in an effort to keep the two unlinked.? In a separate complaint filed today in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the SEC identifies Frank Tamayo as that middleman.? The SEC alleges that Tamayo received material nonpublic information from Steven Metro about 13 impending corporate deals involving clients of the law firm where Metro worked.? Tamayo then tipped his stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, who used the confidential information to illegally trade for himself and for Tamayo and other customers.? Tamayo allocated a portion of his ill-gotten profits for eventual payback to Metro for the inside information.      ?As the middleman, Tamayo was the firewall between Metro and Eydelman.? Metro had the information, Eydelman did the trading, and Tamayo kept them apart,? said Robert Cohen, Co-Deputy Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit.? ?But they were wrong in believing that this would stop the SEC from detecting their scheme.?      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Tamayo.? The U.S. Attorney previously brought criminal actions against Metro and Eydelman.? Those criminal cases and the SEC?s civil case against Metro and Eydelman are pending.      According to the SEC?s complaint against Tamayo, the scheme was deliberately structured to avoid detection, enabling Eydelman and Tamayo to profit without connecting the trades to an insider source and also allowing Metro to share in the trading proceeds.? For a five-year period, Metro repeatedly accessed confidential information in his law firm?s computer systems and met with Tamayo at bars and coffee shops in New York City to provide tips about firm clients ready to participate in a corporate transaction.? Tamayo typically would then connect with Eydelman near the clock at the information booth at Grand Central, where he would show him a post-it note or napkin on which Tamayo wrote the stock ticker symbol of the company to be acquired.? Tamayo then chewed up and sometimes even ate the post-it note or napkin to destroy evidence of the tip.? Tamayo also conveyed to Eydelman the approximate transaction price and timing of the deal.? After Eydelman returned to his office and gathered research about the target company, he would e-mail Tamayo supposed thoughts about why buying the stock made sense.? Their intent was to create a paper trail of e-mails to make it appear they were making their trading decisions based on research and analysis rather than inside information.      The SEC?s complaint charges Tamayo with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and 14e-3 as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

825,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Bank of America Corporation with violating internal controls and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws after it assumed a large portfolio of structured notes and other financial instruments as part of its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.      Bank of America agreed to pay a $7.65 million penalty to settle the charges stemming from regulatory capital overstatements that it made due to its internal accounting control deficiencies and books and records failures.      Regulatory capital refers to the amount of capital that a bank must hold under applicable rules, and it is intended to provide a buffer against adverse market conditions.? According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, at the time of its Merrill Lynch acquisition, Bank of America permissibly recorded the inherited notes at a discount to par.? Bank of America was required to realize losses on the notes as they matured because it redeemed the notes at par.? For the purposes of calculating and reporting its regulatory capital, applicable rules required Bank of America to deduct the realized losses as they occurred.?      However, according to the SEC?s order, by the time 90 percent of the notes had matured as of March 31, 2014, Bank of America had yet to deduct any of the realized losses from its regulatory capital.? Therefore, with each passing fiscal quarter and fiscal year since 2009 as more and more notes matured, Bank of America overstated its regulatory capital by greater and greater amounts in its regulatory filings, eventually reaching billions of dollars.? Bank of America internally discovered the regulatory capital overstatements in mid-April 2014.? After analyzing the issue, it disclosed the overstatements in a Form 8-K filing on April 28, 2014.? Besides correcting its regulatory capital figures in its Form 8-K filing, Bank of America cooperated with SEC staff during the investigation and voluntarily took steps to remediate the insufficiencies that led to the regulatory capital overstatements.      ?Bank of America self-reported its regulatory capital overstatements, remediated the issues quickly, and cooperated in our investigation,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?This penalty reflects credit for that cooperation, which allowed us to conduct our investigation efficiently and effectively.?      Michael J. Osnato, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, added, ?The federal securities laws require all public companies to maintain accurate books and records as well as a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to assure transactions are recorded as necessary.? Bank of America violated these legal requirements, which are specifically geared to ensure the integrity and accuracy of information that eventually is disclosed to investors.?      In addition to the $7.65 million penalty, the SEC?s order requires Bank of America to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The SEC?s orders find that Filip Szymik of New York City and Jordan Peixoto of Toronto engaged in insider trading in Herbalife securities in advance of hedge fund manager William Ackman?s December 20, 2012 announcement of the views of his hedge fund, Pershing Square Management, L.P.?    According to the SEC?s orders, Szymik learned from his roommate, then a Pershing analyst, that Pershing planned to publicly announce its negative view of Herbalife.? Szymik tipped Peixoto, who purchased Herbalife put options on December 19, 2012, one day before the announcement. As a result of his unlawful trading, Peixoto reaped $47,100 in illicit profits.?    ?Szymik and Peixoto chose to engage in illicit tipping and trading in advance of the announcement of market-moving information and today they are being held accountable for those offenses,? said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.?

827,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today sanctioned a New York City-based high frequency trading firm for placing a large number of aggressive, rapid-fire trades in the final two seconds of almost every trading day during a six-month period to manipulate the closing prices of thousands of NASDAQ-listed stocks.? This marks the first high frequency trading manipulation case.      An SEC investigation found that Athena Capital Research used an algorithm that was code-named Gravy to engage in a practice known as ?marking the close? in which stocks are bought or sold near the close of trading to affect the closing price.? The massive volumes of Athena?s last-second trades allowed Athena to overwhelm the market?s available liquidity and artificially push the market price ? and therefore the closing price ? in Athena?s favor.? Athena was acutely aware of the price impact of its algorithmic trading, calling it ?owning the game? in internal e-mails.      Athena agreed to pay a $1 million penalty to settle the SEC?s charges.      ?When high frequency traders cross the line and engage in fraud we will pursue them as we do with anyone who manipulates the markets,? said SEC Chair Mary Jo White.      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, although Athena was a relatively small firm, it dominated the market in the last few seconds of a trading day for stocks that it otherwise traded only slightly. ?The manipulative trading described in the SEC?s order occurred from June to December 2009 and made up more than 70 percent of the total NASDAQ trading volume of the affected stocks in the seconds before the market close.      ?Traders today can certainly use complex algorithms and take advantage of cutting-edge technology, but what happened here was fraud,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ??This action should send a clear message that the Commission and its Division of Enforcement have the expertise to investigate and charge even the most sophisticated fraudulent algorithmic trading strategies.?      The SEC?s order finds that Athena?s manipulative scheme focused on trading in order imbalances in securities at the close of the trading day. ?Imbalances occur when there are more orders to buy shares than to sell shares (or vice versa) at the close for any given stock.? Every day at the close of trading, NASDAQ runs a closing auction to fill all on-close orders at the best price, one that is not too distant from the price of the stock just before the close.? Athena placed orders to fill imbalances in securities at the close of trading, and then traded or ?accumulated? shares on the continuous market on the opposite side of its order.      According to the SEC?s order, Athena?s algorithmic strategies became increasingly focused on ensuring that the firm was the dominant firm ? and sometimes the only one ? trading desirable stock imbalances at the end of each trading day.? The firm implemented additional algorithms known as ?Collars? to ensure that Athena?s orders received priority over other orders when trading imbalances. These eventually resulted in Athena?s imbalance-on-close orders being at least partially filled more than 98 percent of the time.? Athena?s ability to predict that it would get filled on almost every imbalance order allowed the firm to unleash its manipulative Gravy algorithm to trade tens of thousands of stocks right before the close of trading.? As a result, these stocks traded at artificial prices that NASDAQ then used to set the closing prices for on-close orders as part of its closing auction.? Athena?s high frequency trading scheme enabled its orders to be executed at more favorable prices.      The SEC order censures Athena and finds that the firm violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.? Without admitting or denying the findings, Athena agreed to pay the $1 million penalty and cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the securities laws.

828,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced securities fraud charges accusing a New York businessman and his software company of making false statements to investors while raising more than $3 million to fund operations.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that Gregory Rorke falsely told investors that he possessed millions of dollars in liquid assets to personally guarantee their purchase of promissory notes issued by Navagate Inc., which claimed to create and sell computer software to help companies automate certain processes in sales and customer relations. ?Rorke emphasized that he was an experienced businessman and former professor at Columbia Business School, and he signed and distributed a personal financial statement to investors.? However, virtually all of the liquid assets and real estate he claimed as his own in the financial statement actually belonged solely to Rorke?s wife, who did not pledge any of her assets in connection with the securities offering and had no obligation to make good on Rorke?s personal guarantee.? Ultimately, Navagate defaulted on the notes and Rorke did not adhere to his promise to pay investors under his personal guarantee.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division further alleges that when asked for proof that he owned one of the main pledged assets, Rorke covered up his lie by tampering with an account statement to hide the fact that the account belonged solely to his wife.? Rorke also initially failed to disclose and later materially understated the extent of corporate tax problems at Navagate, which owed at least $1 million in payroll taxes to the IRS for which Rorke was personally liable.? As Rorke faced pressure from investors to pay down this liability, he lied in a sworn affidavit that he had sent the IRS a check for $350,000.      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rorke, who lives in Bronxville, N.Y.      ?Rorke comforted investors with a personal guarantee to back their investments in Navagate with his own pledged assets,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office. ??Yet he repeatedly made false statements about his ownership of the pledged assets, even tampering with documents to cover his tracks.?      In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC?s Enforcement Division filed charges against Gregory Osborn and his New Jersey-based broker-dealer Middlebury Securities LLC, which served as the placement agent in selling Navagate securities. ?The SEC?s order states that Osborn and Middlebury Securities repeatedly assured investors that Rorke?s personal guarantee was a good reason to enter into the deal despite knowing or recklessly disregarding that Rorke?s claim was false and he did not solely possess the assets listed in the personal financial statement.? Osborn and Middlebury Securities also orchestrated payments to some earlier Navagate investors by fraudulently using proceeds from additional investors despite knowing or recklessly disregarding that such payments are not permitted.      Osborn and Middlebury Securities agreed to partially settle the case against them with disgorgement and penalties to be determined at a later date.? Osborn agreed to be permanently barred from the securities industry and Middlebury Securities agreed to be censured.? They each consent to the entry of injunctions barring them from violating or causing violations of the federal securities laws.      ?Osborn and Middlebury Securities collected significant placement agent fees while boldly highlighting Rorke?s personal guarantee and assuring investors it was a sound investment opportunity,? said Amelia A. Cottrell, Associate Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.      The SEC?s orders allege that Rorke, Navagate, Osborn, and Middlebury Securities violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.?

829,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today penalized Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for violating the market access rule when it failed to uphold credit limits for a customer firm with a rogue trader who engaged in fraudulent trading of Apple stock.      The market access rule requires broker-dealers to have adequate risk controls in place before providing customers with access to the markets.? An SEC investigation found that Morgan Stanley, which offers institutional customers direct market access through an electronic trading desk, did not have the risk management controls necessary to prevent the rogue trader from entering orders that exceeded pre-set trading thresholds. ?The trader exploited the market access and, without Morgan Stanley?s knowledge, committed a fraud that eventually shuttered the firm where he worked.? The SEC and criminal authorities have since charged the trader with fraud, and he has been sentenced to 30 months in prison.      Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $4 million penalty for violating the market access rule.      ?Broker-dealers become important gatekeepers when they provide customers direct access to our securities markets, and in this case Morgan Stanley did not live up to that responsibility,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?Morgan Stanley failed to have reasonable controls in place to mitigate the risks associated with granting market access to a customer.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, the rogue trader worked at Rochdale Securities LLC and routed to Morgan Stanley?s electronic trading desk a series of orders to purchase Apple stock on Oct. 25, 2012.? The orders came steadily throughout the day and eventually tallied approximately $525 million worth of Apple stock, which significantly exceeded Rochdale?s pre-set aggregate daily trading limit of $200 million at Morgan Stanley.? In order to execute the orders, Morgan Stanley?s electronic trading desk initially increased Rochdale?s limit to $500 million and later to $750 million without conducting adequate due diligence to ensure the credit increases were warranted.? Morgan Stanley?s written supervisory procedures did not provide reasonable guidance for electronic trading desk personnel who determine whether or not to increase customer trading thresholds.      According to the SEC?s order, the rogue trader at Rochdale was using these orders to commit a fraud.? He had intentionally enlarged the amount of Apple stock an actual customer wanted to purchase from 1,625 shares to 1,625,000 shares.? The trader?s scheme was to profit personally from the excess shares if Apple?s stock price increased or claim the order size was merely an error if the stock price decreased.? As it turned out, Apple?s stock price began dropping later that day, so the trader falsely claimed that he had made a mistake in placing order.? Rochdale was left holding the unauthorized purchase and suffered a $5.3 million loss.?

830,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that investment management firm F-Squared Investments has agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it defrauded investors through false performance advertising about its flagship product.      The SEC separately charged the firm?s co-founder and former CEO Howard Present with making false and misleading statements to investors as the public face of F-Squared.      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Massachusetts-based F-Squared, which is the largest marketer of index products using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm began receiving signals from a third-party data provider in September 2008 indicating when to buy or sell an investment.? The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.? They named the new product ?AlphaSector? and launched the first index a month later.? AlphaSector?s indexes quickly became the firm?s largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager.      The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.? In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.? The data used in F-Squared?s advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.? F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as ?not backtested.? ?Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent.      ?Investors must be able to trust that performance advertisements are accurate,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?F-Squared has admitted that it misled its clients over a number of years about the existence and success of its core strategy.?      According to the SEC?s complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squared?s advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.? Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.? F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.? The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.? Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001.?      The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.? The mistake carried the model portfolio?s backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.? The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&P 500 from April 2001 to September 2008.      ?We allege that not only did F-Squared and Present attract clients to this investment strategy by touting a track record they presented as real when it was merely hypothetical, but the hypothetical calculations also were substantially inflated,? said Julie M. Riewe, co-chief of the Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit.

831,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a subsidiary of UBS with disclosure failures and other securities law violations related to the operation and marketing of its dark pool.      UBS Securities LLC agreed to settle the charges by paying more than $14.4 million, including a $12 million penalty that is the SEC?s largest against an alternative trading system (ATS).      An SEC examination and investigation of UBS revealed that the firm failed to properly disclose to all subscribers the existence of an order type that it pitched almost exclusively to market makers and high-frequency trading firms.? The order type, called PrimaryPegPlus (PPP), enabled certain subscribers to buy and sell securities by placing orders priced in increments of less than one cent.? However, UBS was prohibited under Regulation NMS from accepting orders at those prices.? By doing so the firm enabled users of the PPP order type to place sub-penny-priced orders that jumped ahead of other orders submitted at legal, whole-penny prices.?      Furthermore, the SEC investigation found that UBS similarly failed to disclose to all subscribers a ?natural-only crossing restriction? developed to ensure that select orders would not execute against orders placed by market makers and high-frequency trading firms.? This shield was only available to benefit orders placed using UBS algorithms, which are automated trading strategies.? UBS did not disclose the existence of this feature to all subscribers until approximately 30 months after it was launched.      ?The UBS dark pool was not a level playing field for all customers and did not operate as advertised,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Our action shows our continued commitment to policing the equity markets to ensure fairness and compliance with all laws and rules.?      In addition to UBS?s disclosure failures that violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as its acceptance of sub-penny-priced orders that violated Regulation NMS, the SEC outlined several other violations of the federal securities laws by UBS in its order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:      The Form ATS and amendments that UBS filed with the SEC included inconsistent and incomplete statements about the dark pool?s acceptance of sub-penny orders and the natural-only crossing restriction.? The filing also failed to attach certain required documents.     UBS violated requirements under Regulation ATS by unreasonably prohibiting subscribers from using the natural-only crossing restriction and failing to establish written standards for granting access to subscribers.       UBS failed to preserve certain order data for the dark pool from at least August 2008 to March 2009 and August 2010 to November 2010.

832,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against an investment adviser and her New York-based firms accused of hiding the poor performance of loan assets in three collateralized loan obligation (CLO) funds they manage.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that Lynn Tilton and her Patriarch Partners firms have breached their fiduciary duties and defrauded clients by failing to value assets using the methodology described to investors in offering documents for the CLO funds, which have portfolios comprised of loans to distressed companies.? Instead, nearly all valuations of loan assets have been reported to investors as unchanged from the time they were acquired despite many of the companies making partial or no interest payments to the funds for several years.? Investors have not only been misled to believe that objective valuation analyses were being performed, but Tilton and her firms allegedly have avoided significantly reduced management fees because the valuation methodology described in fund documents would have given investors greater fund management control and earlier principal repayments if collateral loans weren?t performing to a particular standard.? Tilton and her firms also consequently have misled investors about asset valuations in fund financial statements.?      ?We allege that instead of informing their clients about the declining value of assets in the CLO funds, Tilton and her firms have consistently misled investors and collected almost $200 million in fees and other payments to which they were not entitled,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division.? ?Tilton violated her fiduciary duty to her clients when she exercised subjective discretion over valuation levels, creating a major conflict of interest that was never disclosed to them.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting an administrative proceeding, CLO funds raise capital by issuing secured notes and using proceeds to purchase a portfolio of collateral typically comprised of commercial loans.? Investors are paid based on cash flows and other proceeds from the collateral.? The three CLO funds managed by Tilton and the Patriarch Partners firms are collectively known as the Zohar funds, and more than $2.5 billion has been raised from investors.? Tilton?s investment strategy for the Zohar funds has been to improve the operations of the distressed portfolio companies so they can pay off their debt, increase in value, and eventually be sold for a profit.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that under the contractual terms of the deals, Tilton and her firms are required to categorize the value of each loan asset in monthly reports by using a specific method set forth in deal documents.? To be assigned the highest category, a loan has to be current in its interest payments to the Zohar funds.? The category of each asset impacts the calculation of a fund?s ?overcollateralization? ratio, which reflects the likelihood that investors will receive a return on their principal.? If the overcollateralization ratio falls below a specific threshold, Tilton and her firms are not entitled to receive certain management fees and may be required to cede more control of fund management to investors.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that rather than following the required methodology for valuing these loan assets, Tilton and her firms have maintained their control over the funds and preserved their management fees by not lowering an asset?s category until she decides to cease financial support of the distressed company.? Thus the valuation of an asset simply reflects Tilton?s subjective assessment of the company?s future.? Absent an actual overcollateralization ratio test, investors aren?t getting a true assessment of the actual values of their investments, which in reality have declined substantially.      The SEC?s Enforcement Division further alleges that Tilton and her firms were responsible for misstatements in the quarterly financial statements of the Zohar funds.? When preparing these financial statements, they failed to conduct a required impairment analysis on the assets of the Zohar funds despite disclosures stating that such analysis had occurred.? They also falsely stated that assets of the Zohar funds were reported at fair value.? Tilton repeatedly and falsely certified that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).      The SEC?s Enforcement Division alleges that Tilton, Patriarch Partners LLC, Patriarch Partners VIII LLC, Patriarch Partners XIV LLC, and Patriarch Partners XV LLC violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8).?

Stewart with confidential information about future mergers and acquisitions involving clients of two investment banks where he has worked during the past few years.? The elder Stewart, a certified public accountant and CFO of a technology company, cashed in on the tips by placing and directing highly profitable securities trades ahead of at least a half-dozen merger and acquisition announcements.?

834,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against the co-owners of a Manhattan-based brokerage firm.      The SEC alleges that as Arjent LLC and its UK-based affiliate Arjent Limited were approaching insolvency, chairman and CEO Robert P. DePalo attempted to keep the firms afloat and maintain his extravagant lifestyle by selling shares in a holding company called Pangaea Trading Partners.? DePalo along with managing director and co-owner Joshua B. Gladtke allegedly misrepresented to investors the value of Pangaea?s assets and how their money would be used ? transferring the first $2.3 million raised in the offering directly to his own bank accounts and using it for his personal benefit.? DePalo also allegedly transferred investor funds to Gladtke, and sought to cover up their fraud by making misrepresentations to SEC examiners.      ?We allege that DePalo and Gladtke sold overvalued interests in Pangaea and then raided investor funds for their own personal benefit,? said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC?s New York Regional Office.? ?They later allegedly falsified records in an effort to cover up their scheme.?      In a parallel action, the New York County District Attorney?s Office today announced criminal charges against DePalo and Gladtke.      The SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan charges DePalo and Gladtke with violating the antifraud and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws.? Also charged in the SEC?s complaint are Pangaea, the Arjent entities, and another entity owned and controlled by DePalo called Excalibur Asset Management.? The SEC also charged another principal at Arjent LLC named Gregg A. Lerman, who agreed to settle the charges.? Subject to court approval, Lerman is enjoined from future violations with any disgorgement and financial penalty amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.

835,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced enforcement actions against 36 municipal underwriting firms for violations in municipal bond offerings. The cases are the first brought against underwriters under the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) Initiative, a voluntary self-reporting program targeting material misstatements and omissions in municipal bond offering documents.?    The Enforcement Division initiative announced in March 2014, offered favorable settlement terms to municipal bond underwriters and issuers who self-reported securities law violations. The first issuer charged under the initiative settled with the SEC in July 2014.    ?The MCDC initiative has already resulted in significant improvements to the municipal securities market, including heightened awareness of issuers? disclosure obligations and enhanced disclosure policies and procedures,? said SEC Chair Mary Jo White.? ?This ongoing enforcement initiative will continue to bring lasting changes to the municipal securities markets for the benefit of investors.?    In today?s actions, the SEC alleged that between 2010 and 2014 the 36 firms violated federal securities laws by selling municipal bonds using offering documents that contained materially false statements or omissions about the bond issuers? compliance with continuing disclosure obligations.? The underwriting firms also allegedly failed to conduct adequate due diligence to identify the misstatements and omissions before offering and selling the bonds to their customers.?    ?The MCDC initiative highlights the importance of continuing disclosure in the municipal bond market and due diligence in the underwriting process,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division.? ?The initiative has brought much needed attention to these issues and has already improved the behavior of participants in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market.??    Continuing disclosure provides municipal bond investors with information, including annual financial reports, on an ongoing basis. ?The SEC?s 2012 Municipal Market Report identified issuers? failure to comply with their continuing disclosure obligations as a major challenge for investors seeking information about their municipal bond holdings.    ?The settlements announced today reflect these underwriters? cooperation in self-reporting their own misconduct and agreeing to improve their procedures going forward,? said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, Chief of the Enforcement Division?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. ?Because these 36 firms underwrite a substantial portion of the country?s municipal bonds each year, we expect a large number of bondholders will benefit from the resulting improvements in due diligence and disclosure.??    The 36 firms, which did not admit or deny the findings, agreed to cease and desist from such violations in the future.? Under the terms of the MCDC initiative, they will pay civil penalties based on the number and size of the fraudulent offerings identified, up to a cap based on the size of the firm.? The maximum penalty imposed is $500,000.? In addition, each firm agreed to retain an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures on due diligence for municipal securities underwriting.?

836,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) with misallocating more than $17 million in so-called ?broken deal? expenses to its flagship private equity funds in breach of its fiduciary duty.      KKR agreed to pay nearly $30 million to settle the charges, including a $10 million penalty.      The SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit has been scrutinizing the private equity industry to make sure that fund managers aren?t misallocating or unfairly charging fees and expenses to investors.? An SEC investigation found that during a six-year period ending in 2011, KKR incurred $338 million in broken deal or diligence expenses related to unsuccessful buyout opportunities and similar expenses.? Even though KKR?s co-investors, including KKR executives, participated in the firm?s private equity transactions and benefited from the firm?s deal sourcing efforts, KKR did not allocate any portion of these broken deal expenses to any of them for years.? KKR did not expressly disclose in its fund limited partnership agreements or related offering materials that it did not allocate broken deal expenses to the co-investors.      ?This is the first SEC case to charge a private equity adviser with misallocating broken deal expenses,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?Although KKR raised billions of dollars of deal capital from co-investors, it unfairly required the funds to shoulder the cost for nearly all of the expenses incurred to explore potential investment opportunities that were pursued but ultimately not completed.?      The SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding also finds that KKR failed to implement a written compliance policy governing its fund expense allocation practices until the end of the six-year period in 2011.      ?KKR?s failure to adopt policies and procedures governing broken deal expense allocation contributed to its breach of fiduciary duty,? said Marshall S. Sprung, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit.? ?A robust compliance program helps investment advisers ensure that clients are not disadvantaged and receive full disclosure about how fund expenses are allocated.?      KKR consented to the entry of the SEC?s order finding that the firm violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7.? KKR agreed to pay more than $14 million in disgorgement ($3.26 million was previously refunded to clients) as well as more than $4.5 million in prejudgment interest and the $10 million penalty.?

837,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs & Co. with violating the market access rule in connection with a trading incident that resulted in erroneous executions of options contracts.      Goldman Sachs agreed to pay a $7 million penalty to settle the charges.      An SEC investigation found that Goldman Sachs did not have adequate safeguards to prevent the firm from erroneously sending approximately 16,000 mispriced options orders to various options exchanges in less than an hour on Aug. 20, 2013, after the firm implemented new electronic trading functionality designed to match internal options orders with client orders.? A software configuration error inadvertently converted the firm?s ?contingent orders? for various options series into live orders and assigned them all a price of $1.? These orders were then sent to the options exchanges during pre-market trading, and approximately 1.5 million options contracts were executed within minutes after the opening of regular market trading. ?Many of the executed trades were later canceled or received price adjustments pursuant to the options exchanges? rules on clearly erroneous trades.      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, Goldman Sachs further violated Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-5 by having deficient controls for preventing orders that would cause the firm to exceed its pre-set capital threshold.      ?Firms that have market access need to have proper controls in place to prevent technological errors from impacting trading,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?Goldman?s control environment was deficient in several ways, significantly disrupted the markets, and failed to meet the standard required of broker-dealers under the market access rule.?      Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit, added, ?It is crucial for broker-dealers with market access to understand and control? the interaction of multiple electronic trading systems, not only to comply with Rule 15c3-5 but also to ensure the orderly operation of the markets as a whole.?      The SEC?s order made the following findings:        Goldman employed unreasonably wide price checks for its options orders during pre-market hours.? Had appropriate price bands been in place similar to those Goldman used during regular trading hours, thousands of the erroneous orders all priced at $1 would have been intercepted and not sent to exchanges.?     On Aug. 20, 2013, a Goldman employee lifted several electronic circuit breaker blocks that automatically shut off outgoing options order messages once the rate of messages exceeded a certain level.     Goldman?s policies regarding these circuit breakers were not properly disseminated or fully understood by employees with responsibilities relating to the circuit breakers.     Goldman?s written policies relating to the implementation of software changes did not require several precautionary steps that, if taken, would likely have prevented the erroneous options incident.     In a separate failure that did not relate to the trading incident, Goldman did not maintain adequate controls designed to prevent the entry of orders that exceed the firm?s capital threshold.? The firm only computed its capital usage level every 30 minutes, did not have an automated mechanism to shut off orders in the event that the firm exceeded its capital threshold, and failed for several months to include a number of business units in the firm?s capital utilization calculation, thereby underestimating the firm?s trading risk.       Goldman consented to the SEC?s order without admitting or denying the findings.? In addition to paying the $7 million penalty, Goldman agreed to cease and desist from further violations of Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Rule 15c3-5.      The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Market Abuse Unit staff Daniel Marcus, Charles Riely, and Matthew Koop and supervised by Mr. Hawke and the unit?s co-deputy chiefs Robert Cohen and Joseph Sansone.?

840,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that St. Louis-based brokerage firm Edward Jones and the former head of its municipal underwriting desk have agreed to settle charges that they overcharged customers in new municipal bonds sales.? It?s the SEC?s first case against an underwriter for pricing-related fraud in the primary market for municipal securities.? The firm also was charged with separate misconduct related to supervisory failures in its review of certain secondary market municipal bond trades.      Municipal bond underwriters are required to offer new bonds to their customers at what is known as the ?initial offering price,? which is negotiated with the issuer of the bonds.? An SEC investigation found that instead of offering bonds to customers at the initial offering price, Edward Jones and Stina R. Wishman took new bonds into Edward Jones? own inventory and improperly offered them to customers at higher prices.? In other instances, Edward Jones entirely refrained from offering the bonds to its customers until after trading commenced in the secondary market, and then offered the bonds at prices higher than the initial offering prices.? The firm?s customers paid at least $4.6 million more than they should have for new bonds.? In one instance, the misconduct resulted in an adverse federal tax determination for an issuer and put it at risk of losing valuable federal tax subsidies.      Edward Jones agreed to settle the case by paying more than $20 million, which includes nearly $5.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that will be distributed to current and former customers who were overcharged for the bonds.? Wishman agreed to pay $15,000 and will be barred from working in the securities industry for at least two years.?      ?Edward Jones undermined the integrity of the bond underwriting process by overcharging retail customers by at least $4.6 million and by misleading municipal issuers,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?This enforcement action, which is the first of its kind, reflects our commitment to addressing abuses in all areas of the municipal bond market.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Edward Jones, the firm?s supervisory failures related to dealer markups on secondary market trades that involved the firm purchasing municipal bonds from customers, placing them into its inventory, and selling them to other customers often within the same day.? Because of the short holding periods, the firm faced little risk as a principal and almost never experienced losses on these intraday trades.? The SEC?s investigation found that Edward Jones? supervisory system was not designed to monitor whether the markups it charged customers for certain trades were reasonable.?      ?Because current rules do not require dealers to disclose markups on municipal bonds, investors receive very little information about their dealer?s compensation in municipal bond trades,? said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. ??It is therefore important that firms have adequate supervisory systems to ensure that they are complying with their fair pricing obligations.??      Edward Jones consented to the SEC order without admitting or denying the findings that the firm willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules G-17, G-11(b) and (d), G-27, and G-30(a) of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).? The firm also failed reasonably to supervise within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act.? Edward Jones undertook a number of remedial efforts and now discloses the percentage and dollar amount of markups on all fixed income retail order trade confirmations in principal transactions.

841,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that BNY Mellon has agreed to pay $14.8 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing valuable student internships to family members of foreign government officials affiliated with a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.      An SEC investigation found that BNY Mellon did not evaluate or hire the family members through its existing, highly competitive internship programs that have stringent hiring standards and require a minimum grade point average and multiple interviews.? The family members did not meet the rigorous criteria yet were hired with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees in order to corruptly influence foreign officials and win or retain contracts to manage and service the assets of the sovereign wealth fund.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, the sovereign wealth fund officials requested that BNY Mellon provide their family members with internships, and they made numerous follow-up requests about the status, timing, and other details of the internships for their relatives.? BNY Mellon employees viewed the internships as important to keep the sovereign wealth fund?s business.?      ?The FCPA prohibits companies from improperly influencing foreign officials with ?anything of value,? and therefore cash payments, gifts, internships, or anything else used in corrupt attempts to win business can expose companies to an SEC enforcement action,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?BNY Mellon deserved significant sanction for providing valuable student internships to family members of foreign officials to influence their actions.?      The SEC?s order finds that BNY Mellon lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the improper hiring practices.? The company did have an FCPA compliance policy, but maintained few specific controls around the hiring of customers and relatives of customers, including foreign government officials.? Sales staff and client relationship managers were permitted wide discretion in their initial hiring decisions, and human resources personnel were not trained to flag potentially problematic hires. ?Senior managers were able to approve hires requested by foreign officials with no mechanism for review by legal or compliance staff. ?BNY Mellon?s system of internal accounting controls was insufficiently tailored to the corruption risks inherent in the hiring of client referrals, and therefore was inadequate to fully effectuate BNY Mellon?s stated policy against bribery of foreign officials.      ?Financial services providers face unique corruption risks when seeking to win business in international markets, and we will continue to scrutinize industries that have not been vigilant about complying with the FCPA,? said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit.      The SEC?s order finds that in 2010 and 2011, BNY Mellon violated the anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.?

842,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Citigroup Global Markets has agreed to settle charges that it failed to enforce policies and procedures to prevent and detect securities transactions that could involve the misuse of material, nonpublic information.? The firm also failed to adopt and implement policies and procedures to prevent and detect principal transactions conducted by an affiliate.      Citigroup agreed to pay a $15 million penalty.      Because broker-dealer employees routinely have access to material nonpublic information, the federal securities laws require every firm to take reasonable steps to prevent the misuse of that information.? An SEC investigation found that Citigroup did not review thousands of trades executed by several of its trading desks during a 10-year period.? Personnel used electronically generated reports to review trades on a daily basis, but technological errors caused the reports to omit several sources of information about thousands of relevant trades.      ?Today?s high-speed markets require that broker-dealers and investment advisers manage the convergence of technology and compliance,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.? ?Firms must ensure that they have devoted sufficient attention and resources to trade surveillance and other compliance systems.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:        The compliance and surveillance failures occurred from 2002 to 2012.     Citigroup also inadvertently routed more than 467,000 transactions on behalf of advisory clients to an affiliated market maker, which then executed the transactions on a principal basis by buying or selling to the clients from its own account.?     Citigroup?s policies and procedures to avoid such occurrences were not reasonably designed or implemented and failed to divert certain advisory orders away from this affiliate.?     Citigroup?s trade surveillance failed to detect these principal transactions for more than two years because the firm relied upon a report that was not reasonably designed to capture the principal transactions executed through this affiliate.?     Citigroup voluntarily paid $2.5 million (its total profits from the principal transactions) to the affected advisory client accounts.       The SEC?s order finds that Citigroup violated Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires brokers and dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information.? Citigroup also violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-(7), which require registered investment advisers to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and its rules.      In addition to the $15 million penalty, Citigroup agreed to retain a consultant to review and recommend improvements to its trade surveillance and advisory account order handling and routing.? Without admitting or denying the findings, Citigroup consented to the SEC?s order that censures the firm and requires it to cease and desist from committing or causing these violations.      The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Owen A. Granke and Carolyn M. Welshhans in the Market Abuse Unit and Marilyn Ampolsk, Jeremiah Williams, and Anthony Kelly in the Asset Management Unit.?

843,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Wall Street CEO and his company, family members, and business associates accused of secretly obtaining control and manipulating the stock of Chinese companies they were purportedly guiding through the process of raising capital and becoming publicly-traded in the United States.  The SEC alleges that Benjamin Wey and New York Global Group (NYGG) typically structured reverse mergers between clients and publicly-traded shell companies in such a way that he and other family members secretly obtained ownership interests of more than five percent of the newly listed companies. To avoid detection and evade SEC reporting requirements as beneficial owners, they divided their shares among a vast network of foreign accounts and generated tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits as they sold the securities into artificially inflated markets.? The illicit profits eventually circled back to Wey and his wife, who used the money to finance a lavish lifestyle.  Also charged in the case in addition to Benjamin Wey and NYGG are his wife Michaela Wey and sister Tianyi Wei, their Switzerland-based broker Seref Dogan Erbek, and two attorneys Robert Newman and William Uchimoto.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Benjamin Wey and Dogan Erbek.  ?We allege that when the Weys and NYGG were supposed to be helping Chinese companies go public in the U.S., they were secretly obtaining control of blocks of their clients? shares so they could manipulate the markets and derive illegal profits.? The Weys and their attorneys went to extraordinary lengths to hide their scheme, but they underestimated our ability to piece it together,? said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.?

844,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged UBS Financial Services Inc. of Puerto Rico and a former branch manager for failing to supervise a former broker who had customers invest in UBSPR affiliated mutual funds using money borrowed from a UBSPR affiliated bank. ?UBSPR and the bank prohibited using such loans to purchase securities and the practice exposed investors to losses while producing profits for the former UBSPR broker, the SEC alleged.    UBSPR agreed to settle the SEC?s charges by paying $15 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties, which will be placed into a fund for harmed investors.? The former branch officer, Ramiro L. Colon III, agreed to a settlement in which he will pay a $25,000 penalty and be suspended from a supervisory role for one year.    Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Puerto Rico against Jose Ramirez, Jr., a former registered representative in UBSPR?s Guaynabo branch office.? The SEC alleges that Ramirez increased his compensation by at least $2.8 million by having certain customers use proceeds from lines of credit with UBS Bank USA to purchase additional shares in UBSPR closed-end mutual funds.? To evade detection, Ramirez allegedly instructed the customers to transfer money from their line of credit to an outside bank account before depositing the funds into their UBSPR brokerage account and purchasing the closed-end funds.? The funds invested heavily in Puerto Rico municipal bonds and lost value as the Puerto Rico bond market declined, requiring the customers to pay down a portion of the loans or risk having their investments liquidated.??    According to the SEC?s complaint, Ramirez misled customers about the safety of the closed-end funds and the risks of investing in them with borrowed money.? He also is alleged to have lied to his branch manager when questioned about suspicious transactions in the closed-end mutual funds. Ramirez was terminated by UBSPR in January 2014.    According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against UBSPR, the broker-dealer lacked procedures and systems to prevent and detect Ramirez?s misconduct. ?UBSPR allegedly was made aware on at least two occasions that Ramirez customers may have been violating internal policy but UBSPR?s policies failed to address reasonable follow up, the order found. ?It also found that although UBSPR prohibited using line of credit proceeds to purchase securities, it had no system to monitor for this when proceeds were transferred outside of UBSPR accounts.    ?Broker-dealers like UBS Puerto Rico must have effective procedures in place designed to detect misconduct by employees under their supervision,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?UBSPR lacked reasonable systems for ensuring compliance with the firm?s prohibition on loan recycling and to ensure that brokers adequately conveyed the risks involved in lines of credit.?    Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC?s Miami Regional Office, added, ?We allege that Ramirez sold tens of millions of dollars of closed-end funds to certain customers while lying to them about the safety of his risky leverage strategy and as a result, those UBSPR customers suffered significant losses.?    According to the SEC?s order instituting settled administrative proceedings against Colon, he was alerted to the possibility that a Ramirez customer was using a line of credit to purchase closed-end funds.? Instead of investigating, Colon allegedly accepted Ramirez?s explanation and did not follow up with the customer.? The order alleges that Colon ignored other information, including the fact that line of credit originations by Ramirez and the Guaynabo branch were far higher than those of other registered representatives and branches.?    The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Sean M. O?Neill of the Miami Regional Office and was supervised by Jason R. Berkowitz. ?Russell Koonin and Sean M. O?Neill will lead the SEC?s litigation against Ramirez.      The SEC appreciates and recognizes the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which announced an action today against UBSPR for the firm?s violation of its rules on supervision and principles of trade.?

845,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that three private equity fund advisers within The Blackstone Group have agreed to pay nearly $39 million to settle charges that they failed to fully inform investors about benefits that the advisers obtained from accelerated monitoring fees and discounts on legal fees.? Nearly $29 million of the settlement will be distributed to affected fund investors.    An SEC investigation found that Blackstone Management Partners, Blackstone Management Partners III, and Blackstone Management Partners IV failed to adequately disclose the acceleration of monitoring fees paid by fund-owned portfolio companies prior to the companies? sale or initial public offering.? The payments to Blackstone essentially reduced the value of the portfolio companies prior to sale, to the detriment of the funds and their investors.? The SEC investigation also found that fund investors were not informed about a separate fee arrangement that provided Blackstone with a much greater discount on services by an outside law firm than the discount that the law firm provided to the funds.    ?Full transparency of fees and conflicts of interest is critical in the private equity industry and we will continue taking action against advisers that do not adequately disclose their fees and expenses, as Blackstone did here,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement.?    ?As the beneficiary of the accelerated monitoring fees, Blackstone violated its fiduciary duty by failing to properly disclose the fees,? said Julie M. Riewe, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit.? ?Blackstone further breached its fiduciary duty by choosing to negotiate a legal fee arrangement with greater benefits for itself than the funds it advised, without properly disclosing the arrangement.?    According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:      Blackstone typically charges a monitoring fee to each portfolio company owned by its funds.? The fee covers advisory and consulting services to the portfolio company and typically is for a ten-year period.?     Before the private sale or initial public offering of certain portfolio companies, Blackstone terminated monitoring agreements and accelerated the payment of future monitoring fees, including in some instances when monitoring services would no longer be provided.? Some of the accelerated fee payments were used to offset management fees.?     Blackstone disclosed its ability to collect monitoring fees prior to investors? commitment of capital but did not disclose its practice of accelerating monitoring fees until after it took the fees.     Blackstone also failed to disclose a legal fee arrangement providing it with a much greater discount on its legal fees than the discount the funds received.?     Blackstone negotiated the arrangement with a law firm that performed a substantial amount of legal work for Blackstone and its funds.? The funds generated significantly more legal fees than Blackstone did.???     Blackstone also failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.     Blackstone consented to the entry of the SEC?s order finding that it breached its fiduciary duty to the funds, failed to properly disclose information to the funds? investors, and failed to adopt and implement reasonably designed policies and procedures.? Without admitting or denying the findings, Blackstone agreed to cease and desist from further violations, to disgorge $26.2 million of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2.6 million, and to pay a $10 million civil penalty.? Blackstone agreed to distribute $28.8 million to affected fund investors.? The settlement reflects Blackstone?s remedial acts and its voluntary and prompt cooperation with the Division of Enforcement?s investigation.?    The Division of Enforcement?s Asset Management Unit is continuing its review of private equity fee and expense issues and encourages private equity fund advisers that have identified such issues to self-report them to the staff. ?As noted in the Division of Enforcement?s Enforcement Manual, self-reporting is one factor that the Commission considers when evaluating cooperation and determining whether and to what extent to extend credit in settlements.    The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Donna Norman and supervised by Anthony Kelly of the Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit.?

846,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a political intelligence firm agreed to admit wrongdoing and pay a $375,000 penalty for compliance failures.      Marwood Group Research LLC also agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant after an SEC investigation found that the firm failed to properly inform compliance officers about instances when analysts obtained potential material nonpublic information from government employees. ?Under Marwood Group?s written policies and procedures, compliance officers are central to the firm?s efforts to prevent confidential or nonpublic information from being released to clients, who in turn could use it to influence their securities trading decisions.      ""Government employees routinely possess and generate confidential market-moving information.? When political intelligence firms like Marwood Group obtain information from government employees, they must take the necessary steps to prevent the dissemination of potentially material nonpublic information obtained in the course of their research,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division.      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:        Marwood Group?s misconduct occurred in 2010, when analysts sought and received information about policy issues or pending regulatory approvals at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.     As part of its business, Marwood Group provided hedge funds and other clients with regulatory updates and analysis about potential timing and developments for future government actions or rulemaking decisions.     In gathering content for these ?research notes,? Marwood Group encouraged its analysts to maintain relationships with government employees.? Since government employees often are familiar with confidential matters at their agencies, such interactions increased the likelihood that Marwood Group employees could acquire material nonpublic information in the course of their work.     Marwood Group?s written policies and procedures expressly prohibited the acquisition and dissemination of material nonpublic information and required employees to bring it to the attention of the compliance department if they encountered anything confidential.     Despite the red flags regarding information received by analysts, Marwood Group drafted research notes and distributed them directly to clients who could have used any material nonpublic information to inform securities trading decisions.     Marwood Group?s analysts failed to bring the information to the compliance department?s attention so it could be properly vetted for any material nonpublic information ripe for insider trading.       The SEC?s order finds that Marwood Group violated Section 15(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Shkreli misappropriated about $120,000 from MSMB Capital Management from October 2009 to July 2011 to unlawfully pay for food, clothing, medical expenses, clothing, office rent, and cash withdrawals.     Shkreli misled investors and prospective investors in MSMB Capital Management about the fund?s size and performance, claiming for example in July 2010 to have ?returned .77% since inception on 11/1/2009.?? In fact, the fund generated losses of about 18 percent.     In another example, Shkreli falsely stated in December 2010 that the fund had $35 million in assets under management.? In fact, the fund had less than $1,000 in assets in its bank and brokerage accounts.     Shkreli lied to one of MSMB Capital Management?s executing brokers in February 2011 about the fund?s ability to settle a sizeable short sale in a pharmaceutical stock in MSMB Capital Management?s account.? This transaction resulted in losses of more than $7 million to the executing broker who had to cover the short position in the open market.     Shkreli misappropriated $900,000 from MSMB Healthcare in 2013 to settle claims asserted by MSMB Capital Management?s executing broker arising out of the losses suffered in the short selling transaction.

According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, JPMS failed to disclose numerous conflicts of interest to certain wealth management clients from 2008 to 2013:        JPMS failed to disclose its preference for J.P. Morgan-managed mutual funds for retail investors in a unified managed account program known as the Chase Strategic Portfolio (CSP) that was sold through Chase Bank branches.     JPMS failed to disclose that the availability and pricing of services provided to JPMS by another J.P. Morgan affiliate was tied to the amount of CSP assets invested in J.P. Morgan proprietary products.     JPMS failed to disclose that certain J.P. Morgan-managed mutual funds purchased for CSP clients offered a less expensive share class and would generate less revenue for a JPMS affiliate than the share class JPMS chose for CSP clients.     JPMS?s Forms ADV for CSP failed to adequately disclose these conflicts of interest.     JPMS failed to implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the violations that occurred.       The SEC?s order also found that JPMCB failed to disclose several conflicts of interest to certain high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients of JPMorgan?s U.S. Private Bank and certain clients of Chase Private Client, who invested in J.P. Morgan Investment Portfolio, a discretionary managed account program available to affluent Chase Bank clients:        From early 2011 to early 2014, JPMCB failed to disclose that it preferred JPMorgan-managed mutual funds for clients with JPMorgan U.S. Private Bank discretionary managed accounts, including purchasers of Global Access Portfolio (GAP) funds, and to clients of Chase Private Client who invested in J.P. Morgan Investment Portfolio.     From 2008 to early 2014, JPMCB failed to disclose that it preferred JPMorgan-managed hedge funds for clients with U.S. Private Bank discretionary management accounts, including purchasers of GAP funds.     From 2008 to 2015, JPMCB failed to disclose its preference to invest certain clients in third-party-managed hedge funds that shared management or performance fees called retrocessions with a JPMCB affiliate.       The SEC?s order finds that JPMS willfully violated Sections 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 and JPMCB willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.? JPMS and JPMCB admitted the facts set forth in the SEC?s order and acknowledged the conduct violated the federal securities laws.? The subsidiaries agreed to jointly pay $127.5 million in disgorgement, $11.815 million in prejudgment interest, and a $127.5 million penalty.? JPMS agreed to be censured, and both subsidiaries agreed to cease and desist from further violations.

851,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that J.P. Morgan?s brokerage business agreed to pay $4 million to settle charges that it falsely stated on its private banking website and in marketing materials that advisors are compensated ?based on our clients? performance; no one is paid on commission.?      An SEC investigation found that although J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) did not pay commissions to registered representatives in its U.S. Private Bank, compensation was not based on client performance.? Advisors were instead paid a salary and a discretionary bonus based on a number of other factors.      ?JPMS misled customers into believing their brokers had skin in the game and were being compensated based on the success of customer portfolios.? But none of the factors JPMS used to determine broker compensation was tied to portfolio performance,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.?      According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:      JPMS made the false and misleading statement about broker compensation from 2009 to 2012.     The misstatement was made to current and prospective customers on JPMS? private banking website as well as a private banking website for its Tampa regional office.?     Among the marketing materials that included the misstatement were a prospecting card, a pitch book, and a marketing letter.     JPMS employees identified the broker compensation statement as inaccurate on four occasions from March 2009 to February 2011.? But JPMS failed to correct the misstatement on each of those occasions.     It wasn?t until May 2012 ? more than three years after it was first made ? that the misstatement was corrected by JPMS in some marketing materials.?       ?Broker-dealers like JPMS have self-interest in representing that their monetary interests are aligned with their customers.?

852,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen will be prohibited from supervising funds that manage outside money until 2018 in order to settle charges for failing to supervise a former portfolio manager who engaged in insider trading while employed at his firm.? In addition, Cohen?s family office firms will be subject to SEC examinations and the firms must retain an independent consultant to conduct periodic reviews of their activities to ensure compliance with securities laws.      ?Before Cohen can handle outside money again, an independent consultant will ensure there are legally sufficient policies, procedures, and supervision mechanisms in place to detect and deter any insider trading,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division. ?The strong combination of a two-year supervisory bar and additional oversight requirements achieves significant and immediate investor protection and deterrence, while ensuring that the activities of his funds are closely monitored going forward.?      The SEC?s order finds that Cohen failed to supervise former portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, who engaged in insider trading in 2008 while employed at CR Intrinsic Investors, an investment advisory firm that was a wholly-owned subsidiary of S.A.C. Capital Advisors LLC, an entity founded and controlled by Cohen.? The order also finds that Cohen ignored red flags that should have caused him to take prompt action to determine whether Martoma was engaged in insider trading.? Instead, Cohen permitted Martoma to make trades based on that information, and Cohen placed similar trades in accounts that Cohen controlled.? Cohen also encouraged Martoma to talk to a doctor about nonpublic drug trial results to inform trading decisions.? Based on these trades, Cohen?s hedge funds earned profits and avoided losses of approximately $275 million.      Under the terms of the settlement, Cohen is prohibited from serving in a supervisory role at any broker, dealer, or investment adviser until 2018, must retain an independent consultant and adopt consultant recommendations, and must submit to on-site SEC examinations of his registered or unregistered firms.      The SEC order also includes provisions to extend the length of the settlement terms in the event the Commission brings a new action against Cohen, a related entity, or an employee supervised by him.? The settlement terms also provide that if Cohen becomes associated in a supervisory capacity with an entity that is a registered broker, dealer, or investment adviser in 2018 or 2019, that entity will retain an independent consultant through Dec. 31, 2019.      Previously in November 2012, the SEC charged CR Intrinsic and Martoma with insider trading.? In March 2013, CR Intrinsic agreed to pay more than $600 million in order to settle the SEC charges.? In July 2013, Cohen?s entities, including S.A.C. Capital Advisors and CR Intrinsic, paid an additional $1.2 billion to resolve criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York.

853,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC have agreed to settle separate cases finding that they violated federal securities laws while operating alternative trading systems known as dark pools and Credit Suisse?s Light Pool.    The New York Attorney General?s office is announcing parallel actions against the two firms.    Barclays agreed to settle the charges by admitting wrongdoing and paying $35 million penalties to the SEC and the NYAG for a total of $70 million.?    Credit Suisse agreed to settle the charges by paying a $30 million penalty to the SEC, a $30 million penalty to the NYAG, and $24.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC for a total of $84.3 million.?    ?These cases are the most recent in a series of strong SEC enforcement actions involving dark pools and other alternative trading systems,? said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. ?The SEC will continue to shed light on dark pools to better protect investors.?    ?Dark pools have a significant role in today?s equity marketplace, and the firms that run these venues must ensure that they do not make misstatements to subscribers about their material operations,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division. ??These largest-ever penalties imposed in SEC cases involving two of the largest ATSs show that firms pay a steep price when they mislead subscribers.??    According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Barclays:     Barclays said that a feature called Liquidity Profiling would ?continuously police? order flow in its LX dark pool and that the firm would run ?surveillance reports every week? for toxic order flow.?     In fact, Barclays did not continuously police LX for predatory trading using the tools it said it would, and it also did not run weekly surveillance reports.     Barclays did not adequately disclose that it sometimes overrode Liquidity Profiling by moving some subscribers from the most aggressive categories to the least aggressive.? The result was that subscribers that elected to block trading against aggressive subscribers nonetheless continued to interact with them.?     Barclays at times misrepresented the type and number of market data feeds that it used to calculate the National Best Bid and Offer in LX.? For example, Barclays represented that it ?utilize[d] direct feeds from exchanges to deter latency arbitrage? when in fact Barclays used a combination of direct data feeds and other, slower feeds in the dark pool.    ?Barclays misrepresented its efforts to police its dark pool, overrode its surveillance tool, and misled its subscribers about data feeds at the very time that data feeds were an intense topic of interest,? said Robert Cohen, co-chief of the Market Abuse Unit.? ?Investors deserve fair and equitable markets without this misbehavior.?    According to the SEC?s orders instituting settled administrative proceedings against Credit Suisse:     Credit Suisse misrepresented that its Crossfinder dark pool used a feature called Alpha Scoring to characterize subscriber order flow monthly in an objective and transparent manner.? In fact, Alpha Scoring included significant subjective elements, was not transparent, and did not categorize all subscribers on a monthly basis.?     Credit Suisse misrepresented that it would use Alpha Scoring to identify ?opportunistic? traders and kick them out of its electronic communications network, Light Pool. In fact, Alpha scoring was not used for the first year that Light Pool was operational. Also, a subscriber who scored ?opportunistic? could continue to trade using other system IDs, and direct subscribers were given the opportunity to resume trading.     Credit Suisse accepted, ranked, and executed over 117 million illegal sub-penny orders in Crossfinder.     Credit Suisse failed to treat subscriber order information confidentially and failed to disclose to all Crossfinder subscribers that their confidential order information was being transmitted out of the dark pool to other Credit Suisse systems.     Credit Suisse failed to inform subscribers that the Credit Suisse order router systematically prioritized Crossfinder over other venues in certain stages of its dark-only routing process.     Finally, CSSU also failed to disclose that it operated a technology called Crosslink that alerted two high frequency trading firms to the existence of orders that CSSU customers had submitted for execution.    ?Two Credit Suisse ATSs failed to operate as advertised, and failed to comply with numerous regulatory requirements over a multi-year period,? said Joseph Sansone, Co-Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. ?The Commission?s action today sends a strong message that the agency will continue to scrutinize ATSs for compliance with the securities laws.??    The SEC?s order finds that Barclays violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3), Rules 15c3-5(c)(1)(i) and 15c3-5(b) of the SEC?s Market Access Rule, and Rules 301(b)(2) and (10).? The order requires Barclays to pay a $35 million penalty, to cease and desist from these violations, censures Barclays, and requires Barclays to engage a third-party consultant to review its marketing of LX, its Market Access Rule compliance, and its compliance with certain requirements of Regulation ATS.    The SEC?s orders find that Credit Suisse violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rules 301(b)(2), (5) and (10) of Regulation ATS, and Rules 602(b) and 612 of Regulation NMS.? The orders require Credit Suisse to cease and desist from these violations, censure Credit Suisse, and require Credit Suisse to pay $30 million in total penalties, disgorgement of $20,675,510.52, and prejudgment interest of $3,639,643.39.?Credit Suisse consented to the SEC?s orders without admitting or denying the findings.

The Analysis and Detection Center within the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit detected an illicit pattern of trading by Gary Pusey, who McClatchey allegedly tipped with nonpublic information on 10 different occasions ahead of public merger announcements. ? ?We will continue enhancing our market surveillance techniques to detect patterns of insider trading and expose schemes, even when alleged perpetrators like McClatchey and Pusey attempt to avoid detection by providing in-person tips and cash payments,? said Joseph Sansone, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit. ? In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges. ? According to the SEC?s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan:  The scheme began in early 2014 after McClatchey and Pusey became close friends upon meeting at a marina where they kept their fishing boats.? One of McClatchey?s job responsibilities was to collect timely information about potential mergers and acquisitions involving clients of the investment bank where he worked in New York City.? McClatchey misused his ready access to confidential information and regularly tipped Pusey. Pusey used the misappropriated nonpublic information as he purchased securities in 10 companies before their acquisitions were announced publicly, enabling him to generate $76,000 in illicit trading profits.? In return for the tips, Pusey provided McClatchey with free services during his bathroom remodel and paid him thousands of dollars in cash that he typically placed in McClatchey?s gym bag while at the marina or handed to him directly in his garage.?  ?

The SEC issued an order finding that Morgan Stanley failed to adopt written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect customer data.? As a result of these failures, from 2011 to 2014, a then-employee impermissibly accessed and transferred the data regarding approximately 730,000 accounts to his personal server, which was ultimately hacked by third parties. ? ?Given the dangers and impact of cyber breaches, data security is a critically important aspect of investor protection.? We expect SEC registrants of all sizes to have policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to protect customer information,? said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. ? According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:  The federal securities laws require registered broker-dealers and investment advisers to adopt written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect customer records and information. Morgan Stanley?s policies and procedures were not reasonable, however, for two internal web applications or ?portals? that allowed its employees to access customers? confidential account information. For these portals, Morgan Stanley did not have effective authorization modules for more than 10 years to restrict employees? access to customer data based on each employee?s legitimate business need. Morgan Stanley also did not audit or test the relevant authorization modules, nor did it monitor or analyze employees? access to and use of the portals. Consequently, then-employee Galen J. Marsh downloaded and transferred confidential data to his personal server at home between 2011 and 2014. A likely third-party hack of Marsh?s personal server resulted in portions of the confidential data being posted on the Internet with offers to sell larger quantities.

856,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that four private equity fund advisers affiliated with Apollo Global Management have agreed to a $52.7 million settlement for misleading fund investors about fees and a loan agreement and failing to supervise a senior partner who charged personal expenses to the funds. An SEC investigation found that the Apollo advisers failed to adequately disclose the benefits they received to the detriment of fund investors by accelerating the payment of future monitoring fees owed by the funds? portfolio companies upon the sale or IPO of those companies.? The lump sum payments received by the Apollo advisers essentially reduced the portfolio companies? value prior to their sale or IPO and reduced amounts available for distribution to fund investors.? The SEC also found that one of the Apollo advisers failed to disclose certain information about interest payments made on a loan between the adviser?s affiliated general partner and five funds.? The purpose of the loan was to defer taxes on carried interest due the general partner.? The loan agreement obligated the general partner to pay interest to the funds during the course of the loan, and the funds? financial statements disclosed that interest was accruing as an asset of the funds.? But that interest was instead ultimately allocated solely to the general partner, which made the disclosures in the financial statements misleading. ?A common theme in our recent enforcement actions against private equity firms is their failure to properly disclose fees and conflicts of interest to fund investors,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?Investors in Apollo funds were not adequately informed about accelerated monitoring fees and separately allocated loan interest, and therefore were unable to gauge their impact on their investments.? According to the SEC?s order instituting the settled administrative proceeding, Apollo?s supervisory failures pertain to a then-senior partner at the firm who was twice caught improperly charging personal items and services to Apollo-advised funds and their portfolio companies.? Other than verbally reprimanding the partner and requiring repayment of improperly submitted expenses, Apollo took no further remedial or disciplinary steps on either occasion.? A firm-wide expense review eventually revealed even more personal expenses the partner improperly charged to fund clients, and this led to the partner?s separation from the firm. ?Apollo failed to take appropriate action to protect its clients upon first learning that a partner was improperly expensing personal items and services to the funds, and its failure resulted in repeated misconduct,? said Anthony S.

The SEC?s complaint filed today in federal court in Brooklyn alleges that Mark Nordlicht and the Platinum funds overstated the value of an oil company that was among their largest assets, and they concealed a growing liquidity crisis by transferring money between the funds, making preferential redemptions to favored investors, and using misrepresentations to attract new investors to the struggling funds during what internal documents described as ?Hail Mary time.?

That company?s noteholders had priority over preferred shares and Platinum?s management and its affiliates were prohibited from participating in any vote among noteholders to change this priority.?

An extravagant ski vacation in Park City, Utah, including a $1,000 per night guest suite.  ?Kang owed a duty not only to the New York State Common Retirement Fund but to the more than one million public servants and beneficiaries that are served by the fund, including police and fire personnel who count on their pensions to take care of them and their families,? said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.? ?This action demonstrates that the SEC will not tolerate public officials who abuse public pension funds to satisfy their own greedy and wanton desires.? According to the SEC?s complaint, Kang, as a fiduciary to the Fund, had a duty to disclose his solicitation and receipt of the gifts and entertainment he received from Schonhorn and Kelley but failed to do so.? Schonhorn and Kelley knew Kang was not disclosing his activities to the Fund, and they took steps to keep the benefits a secret.? Kang, in soliciting and accepting the benefits without any disclosure, violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.? Schonhorn and Kelley participated in the fraudulent scheme and provided substantial assistance to Kang in concealing the scheme from the Fund, thereby violating the antifraud provisions and aiding and abetting Kang?s fraud. ?We allege that rather than compete fairly for business from the New York State Common Retirement Fund?s $50 billion fixed income portfolio, Schonhorn and Kelley bribed their way in, lining their pockets with millions in commissions along the way,? said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Public Finance Abuse Unit.? ?Moreover, they allegedly assisted Kang in covering up his misdeeds, with Kelley going so far as to help Kang obstruct the SEC?s investigation.? In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kang, Schonhorn, and Kelley. The SEC?s complaint charges Kang, Schonhorn, and Kelley with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.?

The SEC used satellite imagery to help uncover the accounting scheme and illustrate its allegation that Homex had not even broken ground on many of the homes for which it reported revenues.  The SEC alleges that Homex, one of the largest homebuilders in Mexico at the time, inflated the number of homes sold during the three-year period by approximately 317 percent and overstated its revenue by 355 percent (approximately $3.3 billion). ?The SEC?s complaint highlights, for example, that Homex reported revenues from a project site in the Mexican state of Guanajuato where every planned home was purportedly built and sold by Dec. 31, 2011. ?Satellite images of the project site on March 12, 2012, show it was still largely undeveloped and the vast majority of supposedly sold homes remained unbuilt.

According to the SEC?s complaint, Worrall serves as a health insurance specialist in the Center for Medicare and tipped Blaszczak about at least three pending CMS decisions that affected the amount of money that companies receive from Medicare to provide services or products related to cancer treatments or kidney dialysis.?

When one victim complained about his losses, a sales representative allegedly said, ?I am tired of hearing from you.? Do you have any rope at home?? If so tie a knot and hang yourself or get a gun and blow your head off.??

The SEC?s order finds that the conflict of interest arose in Merrill Lynch?s handling of third-party products managed by a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign multinational bank, in which more than 1,500 of Merrill?s retail advisory accounts had invested approximately $575 million. According to the order, Merrill put new investments into these products on hold due to pending management changes at the third?party, and Merrill?s governance committee planned to vote on a recommendation to terminate the products and offer alternatives to investors. According to the order, the third-party manager sought to prevent termination and contacted senior Merrill executives, including making an appeal to consider the companies? broader business relationship. Following those communications, and in a break from ordinary practices, the governance committee did not vote and chose to defer action on termination. The governance committee later lifted the hold and opened the third-party products to new Merrill accounts. The SEC?s order found that Merrill failed to disclose to its clients the conflicts of interest in Merrill?s decision-making process.? ?By failing to disclose its own business interests in deciding whether certain products should remain available to investment advisory clients, Merrill Lynch deprived its clients of unbiased financial advice,? said Marc P.

Walgreens agreed to pay a $34.5 million penalty to settle the SEC?s enforcement action. According to the SEC?s order, Walgreens announced a two-step merger with Alliance Boots in June 2012, and at the same time projected that the combined entity would generate $9 billion to $9.5 billion in combined adjusted operating income in the 2016 fiscal year.? After completing the first step of the merger, Walgreens? internal forecasts indicated that the risk of missing its 2016 projection had increasing significantly.? But Walgreens, Wasson, and Miquelon repeatedly publicly reaffirmed the projections without adequately disclosing the increased risk.? When Walgreens subsequently announced that it was moving forward with the second step of the merger in August 2014, it announced a new earnings per share goal that translated to an adjusted operating income projection of $7.2 billion for fiscal 2016, a 20 percent decline over its initial projection.? Walgreens? stock price dropped 14.3% on the day of the announcement. ?Over multiple reporting periods, senior Walgreens executives misled investors about the company?s public financial goal,? said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?The penalty assessed against Walgreens is intended to punish and deter such conduct, which deprived investors of information necessary to make fully informed investment decisions.?

Based upon its extensive cooperation with the SEC's investigation, which included self-reporting and remediation efforts, the SEC did not impose a monetary penalty on the company.

According to the SEC's order, some of the incentives were agreed to orally and not documented, and others were documented only in email exchanges with the distributors.?The SEC's order found that the company lacked sufficient policies and procedures to ensure the incentives were properly documented and accounted for and that Hain's finance department was not aware of the quarterly incentive practices until May 2016.??

890,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against nine defendants for participating in a previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC?s EDGAR system and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading. The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities. The hacker and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not yet been released to the public. The SEC charged the hacker and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see here, here and here). The SEC?s complaint alleges that after hacking the newswire services, Ukrainian hacker Oleksandr Ieremenko turned his attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, gained access in 2016. Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files containing nonpublic earnings results. The information was passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when the companies released the information to the public. In total, the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal profits.  ?International computer hacking schemes like the one we charged today pose an ever-present risk to organizations that possess valuable information,? said Enforcement Division Co-Director Stephanie Avakian. ?Today?s action shows the SEC?s commitment and ability to unravel these schemes and identify the perpetrators even when they operate from outside our borders.? ?The trader defendants charged today are alleged to have taken multiple steps to conceal their fraud, including using an offshore entity and nominee accounts to place trades,? said Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin. ?Our staff?s sophisticated analysis of the defendants? trading exposed the common element behind their success, providing overwhelming evidence that each of them traded based on information hacked from EDGAR.? The SEC?s complaint alleges that Ieremenko circumvented EDGAR controls that require user authentication and then navigated within the EDGAR system. Ieremenko obtained nonpublic ?test files,? which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the filings as intended. Issuers sometimes elected to include nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly earnings results not yet released to the public. Ieremenko extracted nonpublic test files from SEC servers, and then passed the information to different groups of traders. The SEC?s complaint alleges that the following traders received and traded on the basis of the hacked EDGAR information: ? Sungjin Cho, Los Angeles, California  ? David Kwon, Los Angeles, California  ? Igor Sabodakha, Ukraine  ? Victoria Vorochek, Ukraine  ? Ivan Olefir, Ukraine  ? Andrey Sarafanov, Russia  ? Capyield Systems, Ltd. (owned by Olefir)  ?

According to the SEC?s orders, former KPMG audit partners Timothy Daly, Michael Bellach, and John Donovan each engaged in misconduct in connection with exams KPMG administered to test whether its audit professionals understood certain accounting and auditing principles. The orders against Daly and Bellach find that in October 2018, at Daly?s request, Bellach texted Daly images of the questions and answers to a required training examination.

In the second action, the SEC found that VFA failed to disclose conflicts of interest regarding its receipt of millions of dollars of financial benefits that directly resulted from advisory client mutual fund investments that were generally more expensive for clients than other mutual fund investment options available to clients.

The order finds that VFA either directly invested or instructed its primary sub-adviser to select new mutual fund investments for clients that were part of VFA?s clearing broker?s no-transaction fee program (NTF Program), and thus would not incur a transaction fee VFA would be responsible for paying.? The NTF Program mutual funds were generally more expensive than other mutual funds available to VFA clients, including instances when a less expensive mutual fund share class for the same fund was available outside the NTF Program.? The order finds that VFA?s participation in the NTF Program generated three key financial benefits to VFA, and that VFA not only failed to provide disclosures regarding these conflicts, but also provided false and misleading disclosures concerning the conflicts.? The order sets forth that VFA received both 12b-1 fees and revenue sharing from the clearing broker for client investment in mutual funds within the NTF Program.? In addition, according to the order, for clients with wrap agreements in which VFA was responsible for client execution costs, VFA financially benefited by not having to pay any transaction fees for mutual funds in the NTF Program.? Despite being eligible to do so, VFA did not self report its receipt of undisclosed 12b-1 fees as part of the Division of Enforcement?s Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative announced in February 2018. ?Investment advisers must disclose conflicts between their financial interests and those of their clients,? said Mr. Peikin.? ?Here, VFA for years reaped million in benefits at its clients? expenses while not only failing to disclose the conflicts, but while providing false and misleading information.? ?VFA misled clients by telling them that their advisory fee would cover execution costs without also telling them that VFA would put them in more expensive mutual fund share classes and thus avoid paying those costs.? Ms. Avakian added.? ?By not disclosing these practices as well as the other financial benefits VFA received, the firm deprived its clients of essential information about their relationship with their adviser and violated core fiduciary obligations.? Investors can find additional information about how fees and expenses may impact their portfolios at Investor.gov. Summary of Settlement Terms The SEC?s order concerning Florida teachers finds that VFA willfully violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-3 and 206(4)-7 thereunder.? Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, VFA has consented to a cease-and desist order, a censure, and a civil penalty of $20 million.? VFA has also agreed to set advisory fees for all Florida K-12 teachers who currently participate in its advisory product in Florida?s 403(b) and 457(b) retirement programs, or who currently or may within the next five years own certain other VALIC Financial Advisors products, at its most favorable rates in the Florida K-12 market.

914,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Houston-based seismic data company, SAExploration Holdings Inc. (SAE), and four former executives for a multi-year accounting fraud that falsely inflated the company?s revenue by approximately $100 million and concealed the theft of millions of dollars by the executives. SAE issued restated financial statements in February and declared bankruptcy in August. According to the SEC's complaint, starting in 2015, SAE, at the direction of the four executives ? former CEO and Chairman Jeffrey Hastings, former CFO and General Counsel Brent Whiteley, former CEO and COO Brian Beatty, and former VP of Operations Michael Scott ? entered into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was in fact controlled by Hastings and Whiteley. The complaint alleges that, of the amount SAE recorded in revenue, approximately $100 million was improperly recorded in light of the Alaskan company's inability to pay and the SAE executives' control of the company. As alleged in the complaint, to create the false impression that the Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott misappropriated nearly $6 million from SAE and used the funds for a series of round trip transactions that caused the money to be sent back to SAE. The complaint alleges that, in addition, the executives also stole a total of approximately $6 million for themselves. The complaint further alleges that Whiteley separately misappropriated an additional $4 million through a fictitious invoice scheme. ""As alleged in our complaint, SAE's executives designed a multi-faceted fraud that enriched executives at the expense of investors,"" said Jennifer Leete, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement. ""We will vigorously pursue wrongdoing by individuals and companies who engage in fraud and mislead investors.""

Tolstedt for their roles in allegedly misleading investors about the success of the Community Bank, Wells Fargo?s core business.?The SEC?s filings include settled charges against Stumpf, who agreed to pay a $2.5 million penalty, and a litigated action alleging Tolstedt committed fraud. The SEC previously filed settled charges against Wells Fargo for engaging in the misconduct.?  According to the SEC?s complaint against Tolstedt, from mid-2014 through mid-2016, Tolstedt publicly described and endorsed Wells Fargo?s ?cross-sell metric? as a means of measuring Wells Fargo?s financial success despite the fact that this metric was inflated by accounts and services that were unused, unneeded, or unauthorized. The complaint further alleges that Tolstedt signed misleading sub-certifications as to the accuracy of Wells Fargo?s public disclosures when she knew or was reckless in not knowing that statements in those disclosures regarding Wells Fargo?s cross-sell metric were materially false and misleading. The SEC?s order against Stumpf finds that in 2015 and 2016 he signed and certified statements filed with the Commission, which he should have known were misleading, regarding both Wells Fargo?s Community Bank cross-sell strategy and its reported metric. According to the order, Stumpf failed to assure the accuracy of his certifications after being put on notice that Wells Fargo was misleading the public about the cross-sell metric.  ?If executives speak about a key performance metric to promote their business, they must do so fully and accurately,? said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC?s Division of Enforcement. ?The Commission will continue to hold responsible not only the senior executives who make false and misleading statements but also those who certify to the accuracy of misleading statements despite warnings to the contrary.?

The action is the SEC's first charging a public company for misleading investors about the financial effects of the pandemic. As set forth in the SEC's order, in its SEC filings on March 23 and April 3, 2020, The Cheesecake Factory stated that its restaurants were ""operating sustainably""?during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the order, the filings were materially false and misleading because the company's internal documents at the time showed that the company was losing approximately $6 million in cash per week and that it projected that it had only 16 weeks of cash remaining. The order finds that although the company did not disclose this internal information in its March 23 and April 3 filings, the company did share this information with potential private equity investors or lenders in connection with an effort to seek additional liquidity. The order also finds that, although the March 23 filing described actions the company had undertaken to preserve financial flexibility during the pandemic, it failed to disclose that The Cheesecake Factory had already informed its landlords that it would not pay rent in April due to the impacts that COVID-19 inflicted on itsbusiness. ""During the pandemic, many public companies have discharged their disclosure obligations in a commendable manner, working proactively to keep investors informed of the current and anticipated material impacts of COVID-19 on their operations and financial condition,""?said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.

Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges. According to the SEC?s order, between 2015 and late 2018, Robinhood made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications, including in FAQ pages on its website, about its largest revenue source when describing how it made money ? namely, payments from trading firms in exchange for Robinhood sending its customer orders to those firms for execution, also known as ?payment for order flow.?? As the SEC?s order finds, one of Robinhood?s selling points to customers was that trading was ?commission free,? but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers? orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers? prices.? Despite this, according to the SEC?s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors.? The order finds that Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.? Robinhood made these false and misleading statements during the time in which it was growing rapidly. ?Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,? said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC?s Enforcement Division.? ?Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.? ?Robinhood failed to seek to obtain the best reasonably available terms when executing customers? orders, causing customers to lose tens of millions of dollars,? said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit.? ?Today?s action sends a clear message that the Commission will not allow brokers to ignore their obligations to customers.? ?There are many new companies seeking to harness the power of technology to provide alternative ways for people to invest their money,? added Erin E.

The SEC?s complaint further alleges that GPB Capital and Ascendant Capital made misrepresentations to investors about millions of dollars in fees and other compensation received by Gentile and Schneider.?

On these calls, the AT&T executives allegedly disclosed AT&T's internal smartphone sales data and the impact of that data on internal revenue metrics, despite the fact that internal documents specifically informed Investor Relations personnel that AT&T's revenue and sales of smartphones were types of information generally considered ?material? to AT&T investors, and therefore prohibited from selective disclosure under Regulation FD.?The complaint further alleges that as a result of what they were told on these calls, the analysts substantially reduced their revenue forecasts, leading to the overall consensus revenue estimate falling to just below the level that AT&T ultimately reported to the public on April 26, 2016.

921,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC for failures relating to a previously undisclosed quality control feature of one of its volatility-related indices, which led S&P DJI to publish and disseminate stale index values during a period of unprecedented volatility.? The SEC?s order finds that the S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index ER (Index) published by S&P DJI was intended to calculate values based on real-time prices of certain CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) futures contracts.? According to the order, S&P DJI licenses the Index to, among others, issuers that use it to offer securities, including the issuer of the inverse exchange-traded note called XIV, and the license agreement requires S&P DJI?s approval of the description of the index in offering documents.? On Monday, Feb. 5, 2018, the VIX experienced a spike of 115%, but the Index remained static during certain intervals between 4:00 p.m. and 5:08 p.m. that day.? According to the SEC?s order, this was due to an undisclosed ?Auto Hold? feature, which is triggered if an index value breaches certain thresholds, at which point the immediately prior index value continues to be reported.? The SEC found that XIV?s issuer derived information about the Index from S&P DJI?s public disclosures about the Index, but the Auto Hold feature had never been publicly disclosed.? The SEC?s order finds that S&P DJI personnel did not release the Auto Hold for the Index during the referenced intervals, as they had the ability to do, resulting in the publication and dissemination of stale and static Index values, rather than values based on the real-time prices of certain VIX futures contracts. The SEC?s order finds that, because the Index was the primary input for the calculation of the XIV ETN?s indicative value, the ETN?s indicative values published to the market during the same intervals were similarly static and, as a result, the indicative values being reported in real-time were higher than they would have been if the Auto Hold had not been triggered.? While the Auto Hold was in place freezing the values being published to the market, XIV?s indicative value breached a key metric, which provided XIV?s issuer the right to accelerate all outstanding notes.? According to the SEC?s order, XIV therefore had an economic value that was substantially lower than what had been publicly reported and was at risk of being accelerated by its issuer.? ?Index providers like S&P DJI play a crucial role in the financial markets,? said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Complex Financial Instruments Unit.? ?When index providers license their indices for the issuance of securities, as S&P DJI did here, they must ensure that the disclosure of critical features of their products as well as the publication of real-time values are accurate.?

923,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Trevor R. Milton, the founder, former CEO and former executive chairman of Nikola Corporation, for repeatedly disseminating false and misleading information ? typically by speaking directly to investors through social media ? about Nikola?s products and technological accomplishments. The SEC?s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Milton founded Nikola in 2015 with the primary goal of manufacturing trucks that run on alternative fuels with low or zero emissions, and building an alternative fuel station infrastructure to support those vehicles.? Milton allegedly helped Nikola raise more than $1 billion in private offerings and go public through a business combination conducted by a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).? According to the SEC?s complaint, during that time and after Nikola was publicly traded, Milton acted as Nikola?s primary spokesperson appearing regularly on national media and communicating directly with investors through social media.? Milton allegedly encouraged investors to follow him on social media to get ?accurate information? about the company ?faster than anywhere else.?? Instead, however, Milton allegedly used his extensive media platform to repeatedly mislead investors about, among other things, Nikola?s technological advancements, products, in-house production capabilities, and commercial achievements.? The complaint further alleges that Milton ultimately reaped tens of millions of dollars in personal benefits as a result of his misconduct. ?Having chosen to promote Nikola through social media, Milton was obligated under the securities laws to communicate completely, accurately and truthfully,? said Gurbir S.

According to the SEC's complaint, Sung Mo ""Jay"" Jun was at the center of a long-running scheme to illegally trade on non-public information concerning the growth in Netflix's subscriber base, a key metric Netflix reported in its quarterly earnings announcements. The complaint alleges that Sung Mo Jun, while employed at Netflix in 2016 and 2017, repeatedly tipped this information to his brother, Joon Mo Jun, and his close friend, Junwoo Chon, who both used it to trade in advance of multiple Netflix earnings announcements. The SEC's complaint further alleges that after Sung Mo Jun left Netflix in 2017, he obtained confidential Netflix subscriber growth information from another Netflix insider, Ayden Lee. Sung Mo Jun allegedly traded himself and tipped Joon Jun and Chon in advance of Netflix earnings announcements from 2017 to 2019. The SEC alleges that Sung Mo Jun's former Netflix colleague Jae Hyeon Bae, another Netflix engineer, tipped Joon Jun based on Netflix's subscriber growth information in advance of Netflix's July 2019 earnings announcement. Sung Mo Jun, Joon Jun, and Chon allegedly used encrypted messaging applications to discuss their trading in an attempt to evade detection.

927,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Sergei Polevikov, who worked as a quantitative analyst at two prominent asset management firms, for perpetrating a years-long front-running scheme that generated illicit profits of at least $8.5 million. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, from at least January 2014 through October 2019, Polevikov had access to real-time, non-public information about the size and timing of his employers' securities orders and trades, and used that information to secretly trade on, and ahead of, his employers' trades. As alleged, Polevikov, on nearly 3,000 occasions, bought or sold a stock on the same side of the market as his employers before his employers executed trades in the same stock for their fund clients. Polevikov typically would close his positions the same day as he opened them, capitalizing on the price movement caused by his employers' large trades. The SEC alleges that Polevikov concealed his fraudulent scheme by executing the trades in the account of his wife, Maryna Arystava, who uses a different last name. The investigation originated from the SEC's Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns, such as improbably successful trading across different securities over time. These capabilities enabled the SEC to spot Polevikov's trading activities which consistently generated small profits that added up to a total of at least $8.5 million over the course of the scheme. ""As alleged in our complaint, Polevikov abused his position as a quantitative analyst and his employers' trust by repeatedly trading ahead of large trades that the firms placed for advisory clients,"" said Joseph G.

Schottenstein also allegedly received information and traded ahead of the February 2018 announcement of a merger agreement between Albertsons Companies, Inc. and Rite Aid. According to the complaint, Schottenstein obtained the information from a cousin who served on the board of directors of both DSW and the company that had attempted to acquire Aphria, and whose family owned a private business that was involved in the Rite Aid transaction. Schottenstein allegedly generated illicit gains of more than $600,000 in his personal brokerage accounts from these three market moving announcements and tipped two close friends, Kris Bortnovsky, also of Surfside, and Ryan Shapiro of Bay Harbor Island, Fla., who traded ahead of these announcements. Bortnovsky, who managed investment vehicles in which Schottenstein had invested, allegedly placed illicit trades for his investment management firm, defendant Sakal Capital Management, LLC, and one of its hedge funds, defendant Sakal U.S. Fund, LLC, in addition to trading in individual brokerage accounts owned by himself and another person. According to the SEC?s complaint, Bortnovsky used these various accounts to trade ahead of all three announcements for total profits of more than $4 million.

The SEC?s complaint alleges that, from at least 2017 through February 2021, Velissaris engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overvalue assets held by the Infinity Q Diversified Alpha mutual fund and the Infinity Q Volatility Alpha private fund. According to the complaint, Velissaris executed the overvaluation scheme by altering inputs and manipulating the code of a third-party pricing service used to value the funds? assets. Velissaris allegedly collected more than $26 million in profit distributions through his fraudulent conduct and without disclosing his activities to investors.

The complaint alleges that at times during the pandemic, the funds? actual values were half of what investors were told. In February 2021, Velissaris was removed from his role with Infinity Q after SEC staff confronted the firm with information suggesting that Velissaris had been adjusting the third-party pricing model.

930,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Sung Kook (Bill) Hwang, the owner of family office Archegos Capital Management, LP (Archegos), with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The SEC also charged Archegos?s Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Halligan; head trader, William Tomita; and Chief Risk Officer, Scott Becker for their roles in the fraudulent scheme. The SEC?s complaint alleges that, from at least March 2020 to March 2021, Hwang purchased on margin billions of dollars of total return swaps. These security-based swaps allow investors to take on huge positions in equity securities of companies by posting limited funds up front. As alleged, Hwang frequently entered into certain of these swaps without any economic purpose other than to artificially and dramatically drive up the prices of the various companies? securities, which induced other investors to purchase those securities at inflated prices. As a result of Hwang?s trading, Archegos allegedly underwent a period of rapid growth, increasing in value from approximately $1.5 billion with $10 billion in exposure in March 2020 to a value of more than $36 billion with $160 billion in exposure at its peak in March 2021. The complaint also alleges that, as part of the scheme, Archegos repeatedly and deliberately misled many of Archegos?s counterparties about Archegos?s exposure, concentration and liquidity, in order to get increased trading capacity so that Archegos could continue buying swaps in its most concentrated positions, thereby driving up the price of those stocks. ?Ultimately in March 2021, price declines in Archegos?s most concentrated positions allegedly triggered significant margin calls that Archegos was unable to meet, and Archegos?s subsequent default and collapse resulted in billions of dollars in credit losses among Archegos?s counterparties.

Aderton, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit and a member of the Task Force. ?As this action illustrates, the Commission will hold investment advisers accountable when they do not accurately describe their incorporation of ESG factors into their investment selection process.? BNY Mellon Investment Adviser consented to the entry of the SEC?s order finding that it violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-7 and 206(4)-8, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, BNY Mellon Investment Adviser agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay a $1.5 million penalty. The SEC?s order also noted that BNY Mellon Investment Adviser promptly undertook remedial acts and cooperated with Commission staff in its investigation. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Robert Baker and Michael Moran with the Enforcement Division?s Asset Management Unit in the Boston Regional Office.? SEC staff involved in the examination that led to the investigation included Mayeti Gametchu, Kenneth Leung, Albert Monsini, and Alexander Pevzner, all in the Boston Regional Office. The Division of Enforcement?s Climate and ESG Task Force was formed in March 2021, and among other things, it analyzes disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers? and funds?

933,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that UBS Financial Services Inc. has agreed to pay approximately $25 million to settle fraud charges relating to a complex investment strategy referred to as YES, or Yield Enhancement Strategy. According to the SEC?s order, UBS marketed and sold YES to approximately 600 investors through its platform of domestic financial advisors from February 2016 through February 2017. The order finds that, during this time, UBS did not provide its financial advisors with adequate training and oversight in the strategy, and although UBS recognized and documented the possibility of significant risk in YES investments, it failed to share this data with advisors or clients. As a result, the order finds, some of UBS?s advisors did not understand the risks and were unable to form a reasonable belief that the advice they provided was in the best interest of their clients. When investors suffered losses, many of them, along with their financial advisors, expressed surprise and closed their YES accounts. ?Advisory firms are obligated to implement appropriate policies and procedures to ensure all parties involved in the sale of complex financial products and strategies have a clear understanding of the risks those products present,? said Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Division of Enforcement?s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. ?As fiduciaries, advisers also must make suitable recommendations to their clients. Complex products can present unique risks, and the SEC will remain vigilant and continue to take action to protect those who invest in these products from misconduct.? UBS consented to the entry of the SEC?s order finding that it violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7. Without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings, UBS agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement of $5.8 million and prejudgment interest of $1.4 million, which is deemed satisfied by payments made to investors in related arbitration proceedings. UBS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $17.4 million, which it will undertake to distribute to harmed investors pursuant to the fair fund provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by James F. Murtha, Jonathan C. Shapiro and Brent S. Mitchell, and was supervised by Reid A.

934,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a former Coinbase product manager, his brother, and his friend for perpetrating a scheme to trade ahead of multiple announcements regarding certain crypto assets that would be made available for trading on the Coinbase platform.? The SEC?s complaint alleges that, while employed at Coinbase, Ishan Wahi helped to coordinate the platform?s public listing announcements that included what crypto assets or tokens would be made available for trading. According to the SEC?s complaint, Coinbase treated such information as confidential and warned its employees not to trade on the basis of, or tip others with, that information. However, from at least June 2021 to April 2022, in breach of his duties, Ishan repeatedly tipped the timing and content of upcoming listing announcements to his brother, Nikhil Wahi, and his friend, Sameer Ramani. Ahead of those announcements, which usually resulted in an increase in the assets? prices, Nikhil Wahi and Ramani allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, at least nine of which were securities, and then typically sold them shortly after the announcements for a profit.

936,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against nine individuals in connection with three separate alleged schemes that together yielded more than $6.8 million in ill-gotten gains. Those charged include a former chief information security officer (CISO), an investment banker, and a former FBI trainee, all of whom allegedly shared confidential information with their friends, who then traded on that confidential information. Each of the three actions announced today originated from the SEC Enforcement Division?s Market Abuse Unit?s (MAU) Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns. The SEC's enforcement actions were filed in federal district court in Manhattan, and in each case the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges. ""If everyday investors think that the market is rigged at their expense in favor of insiders who abuse their positions, they are not going to invest their hard earned money in the markets,"" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. ""But as today's actions show, we stand ready to leverage all of our expertise and tools to root out misconduct and to hold bad actors accountable no matter the industry or profession. That's what?s required to restore investor trust and confidence."" The SEC?s complaints charge all nine defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and seek permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. In all three cases, the SEC?s investigation is ongoing. Chief Information Security Officer Tipped Friends In one action, the SEC alleges that Amit Bhardwaj, the former CISO of Lumentum Holdings Inc., and his friends, Dhirenkumar Patel, Srinivasa Kakkera, Abbas Saeedi, and Ramesh Chitor, traded ahead of two corporate acquisition announcements by Lumentum, thereby generating more than $5.2 million in illicit profits. The SEC?s complaint alleges that, through his work at Lumentum, Bhardwaj learned material nonpublic information (MNPI) about the company?s plans to first acquire Coherent, Inc. and later acquire NeoPhotonics Corporation. Based on this MNPI, Bhardwaj allegedly purchased Coherent securities ahead of the January 2021 announcement of Lumentum?s agreement to acquire Coherent and tipped his friend Patel, with the understanding that Patel would later share some of his ill-gotten gains. The SEC further alleges that, during October 2021, Bhardwaj shared MNPI about Lumentum?s planned acquisition of NeoPhotonics with his friends Kakkera, Saeedi, and Chitor, who then amassed large positions of NeoPhotonics based on Bhardwaj?s tips. After the November 2021 announcement of the NeoPhotonics acquisition, Chitor indirectly transferred funds to Bhardwaj?s relative in India, as instructed by Bhardwaj. In addition to the relief described above, the SEC?s complaint seeks disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest from relief defendants Gauri Salwan, the Kakkera Family Trust, All US Tacos Inc., and Janya Saeedi. The case was investigated by Ann Marie Preissler, Joshua Geller, John Rymas, and Simona Suh of the MAU, and by Elzbieta Wraga of the New York Regional Office (NYRO). Ms. Preissler, Mr. Geller, and Ms. Suh will lead the SEC?s litigation. Investment Banker Tipped Friend In another action, the SEC alleges insider trading by investment banker Brijesh Goel and his friend Akshay Niranjan, who was a foreign exchange trader at a large financial institution. The SEC alleges that the two men, close friends from business school, made more than $275,000 from illegally trading ahead of four acquisition announcements in 2017 that Goel learned about through his employment. The complaint further alleges Niranjan purchased call options on the target companies and later wired Goel $85,000 for Goel?s share of the proceeds. The case was investigated by Andrew Palid, David Makol, and Michele T. Perillo of the MAU, and by Chip Harper of the Boston Regional Office (BRO). Messrs. Harper and Palid along with Amy Burkart from BRO will lead the SEC?s litigation. Former FBI Trainee Tipped Friend Finally, in a third action, the SEC alleges that Seth Markin, a former FBI trainee, and his friend Brandon Wong made approximately $82,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, from illegally trading ahead of the February 2021 announcement of a tender offer by Merck & Co., Inc., to acquire Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. The SEC?s complaint alleges that Markin secretly reviewed the binder of deal documents about the planned tender offer from his then-romantic partner, who worked as an associate for a law firm representing Merck on the deal, traded on the MNPI, and tipped his close friend Wong. The complaint alleges that, after the announcement, Wong bought Markin a Rolex watch to thank him for the tip. The case was investigated by Tracy Sivitz, Chevon Walker, John Rymas, and Simona Suh of the MAU, and by Neil Hendelman of NYRO. Mses. Sivitz, Walker, and Suh will lead the SEC?s litigation.

937,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 11 individuals for their roles in creating and promoting Forsage, a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from millions of retail investors worldwide, including in the United States. Those charged include the four founders of Forsage, who were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia, and Indonesia, as well as three U.S.-based promoters engaged by the founders to endorse Forsage on its website and social media platforms, and several members of the so-called Crypto Crusaders?the largest promotional group for the scheme that operated in the United States from at least five different states. According to the SEC?s complaint, in January 2020, Vladimir Okhotnikov, Jane Doe a/k/a Lola Ferrari, Mikhail Sergeev, and Sergey Maslakov launched Forsage.io, a website that allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the Ethereum, Tron, and Binance blockchains. However, Forsage allegedly has operated as a pyramid scheme for more than two years, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the scheme.? Forsage also allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier investors in a typical Ponzi structure. Despite cease-and-desist actions against Forsage for operating as a fraud in September 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines and in March 2021 by the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means. ""As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,"" said Carolyn Welshhans, Acting Chief of the SEC?s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. ""Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.""

Theissen, of Hartford, Wis., with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC?s complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, two of the defendants, Ellis and Theissen, agreed to settle the charges and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity. Additionally, Ellis agreed to pay disgorgement and civil penalties, and Theissen will be required to pay disgorgement and civil penalties as determined by the court.

938,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged The Boeing Company and its former CEO, Dennis A. Muilenburg, with making materially misleading public statements following crashes of Boeing airplanes in 2018 and 2019. The crashes involved Boeing?s 737 MAX airplane and a flight control function called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). According to the SEC?s orders, after the first crash, Boeing and Muilenburg knew that MCAS posed an ongoing airplane safety issue, but nevertheless assured the public that the 737 MAX airplane was ?as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies.? Later, following the second crash, Boeing and Muilenburg assured the public that there were no slips or gaps in the certification process with respect to MCAS, despite being aware of contrary information. ""There are no words to describe the tragic loss of life brought about by these two airplane crashes,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""In times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets. The Boeing Company and its former CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, failed in this most basic obligation. They misled investors by providing assurances about the safety of the 737 MAX, despite knowing about serious safety concerns. The SEC remains committed to rooting out misconduct when public companies and their executives fail to fulfill their fundamental obligations to the investing public."" According to the SEC?s order, one month after Lion Air Flight 610, a 737 MAX airplane, crashed in Indonesia in October 2018, Boeing issued a press release, edited and approved by Muilenburg, that selectively highlighted certain facts from an official report of the Indonesian government suggesting that pilot error and poor aircraft maintenance contributed to the crash. The press release also gave assurances of the airplane?s safety, failing to disclose that an internal safety review had determined that MCAS posed an ongoing ?airplane safety issue? and that Boeing had already begun redesigning MCAS to address that issue, according to the SEC?s orders. Approximately six weeks after the March 2019 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another 737 MAX, and the grounding by international regulators of the entire 737 MAX fleet, Muilenburg, though aware of information calling into question certain aspects of the certification process relating to MCAS, told analysts and reporters that ?there was no surprise or gap . . . that somehow slipped through [the] certification process? for the 737 MAX and that Boeing had ?gone back and confirmed again . . . that we followed exactly the steps in our design and certification processes that consistently produce safe airplanes.? ""Boeing and Muilenburg put profits over people by misleading investors about the safety of the 737 MAX all in an effort to rehabilitate Boeing's image following two tragic accidents that resulted in the loss of 346 lives and incalculable grief to so many families,"" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. ""But public companies and their executives must provide accurate and complete information when they make disclosures to investors, no matter the circumstances. When they don't, we will hold them accountable, as we did here."" The SEC?s orders against Boeing and Muilenburg find that they negligently violated the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws.

According to the SEC?s order, Oracle subsidiaries in Turkey and UAE also used the slush funds to pay for foreign officials to attend technology conferences in violation of Oracle policies and procedures. The order found that in some instances, employees of the Turkey subsidiary used these funds for the officials? families to accompany them on international conferences or take side trips to California. The SEC previously sanctioned Oracle in connection with the creation of slush funds.

Investigations as to other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing. According to the SEC?s complaint, since at least May 2019, FTX, based in The Bahamas, raised more than $1.8 billion from equity investors, including approximately $1.1 billion from approximately 90 U.S.-based investors. In his representations to investors, Bankman-Fried promoted FTX as a safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform, specifically touting FTX?s sophisticated, automated risk measures to protect customer assets. The complaint alleges that, in reality, Bankman-Fried orchestrated a years-long fraud to conceal from FTX?s investors (1) the undisclosed diversion of FTX customers? funds to Alameda Research LLC, his privately-held crypto hedge fund; (2) the undisclosed special treatment afforded to Alameda on the FTX platform, including providing Alameda with a virtually unlimited ?line of credit? funded by the platform?s customers and exempting Alameda from certain key FTX risk mitigation measures; and (3) undisclosed risk stemming from FTX?s exposure to Alameda?s significant holdings of overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens. The complaint further alleges that Bankman-Fried used commingled FTX customers? funds at Alameda to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations. ""We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.

953,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Honeywell International Inc. for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of bribery schemes that took place in Brazil and Algeria. The company has agreed to pay more than $81 million to settle the SEC?s charges. The SEC?s order finds that Honeywell, a U.S.-based global manufacturer of aerospace, building technologies, and automation products, engaged in a bribery scheme involving intermediaries and employees of its U.S. subsidiary to obtain business from the Brazil state-owned entity Petrobras. Specifically, the order finds that, in 2010, Honeywell offered at least $4 million in bribes to a high-ranking Brazilian government official in connection with the bidding process at Petrobras. The SEC?s order also finds that, in 2011, employees and agents of Honeywell?s Belgian subsidiary paid more than $75,000 in bribes to an Algerian government official to obtain and retain business with the Algerian state-owned entity Sonatrach. ""For years, Honeywell neglected to implement sufficient internal accounting controls to mitigate against known corruption risks in countries like Brazil and Algeria,"" said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division?s FCPA Unit. ""This failure created an environment in which Honeywell employees and agents could and did facilitate bribes."" Honeywell consented to the SEC?s order that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC?s order provides for an offset of up to approximately $38.7 million of any payments made to Brazilian authorities. Therefore, the company?s minimum payment to the SEC would be approximately $42.4 million. In a parallel case, Honeywell also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay more than $78 million to settle criminal charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Honeywell also agreed to settle additional charges brought by the Brazilian government. The SEC?s investigation was conducted by Catherine W. Brilliant and Maria F.

954,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and Zixiao (Gary) Wang, the former Chief Technology Officer of FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX), for their roles in a multiyear scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX, the crypto trading platform co-founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried and Wang. Investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing. According to the SEC?s complaint, between 2019 and 2022, Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, furthered the scheme by manipulating the price of FTT, an FTX-issued exchange crypto security token, by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up its price. FTT served as collateral for undisclosed loans by FTX of its customers? assets to Alameda, a crypto hedge fund owned by Wang and Bankman-Fried and run by Ellison. The complaint alleges that, by manipulating the price of FTT, Bankman-Fried and Ellison caused the valuation of Alameda?s FTT holdings to be inflated, which in turn caused the value of collateral on Alameda?s balance sheet to be overstated, and misled investors about FTX?s risk exposure. In addition, the complaint alleges that, from at least May 2019 until November 2022, Bankman-Fried raised billions of dollars from investors by falsely touting FTX as a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and by telling investors that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges; meanwhile, Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted FTX customer assets to Alameda. The complaint alleges that Ellison and Wang knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading.? The complaint also alleges that Ellison and Wang were active participants in the scheme to deceive FTX?s investors and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success. The complaint alleges that Wang created FTX?s software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds, and Ellison used misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda?s trading activity. The complaint further alleges that, even as it became clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried, with the knowledge of Ellison and Wang, directed hundreds of millions of dollars more in FTX customer funds to Alameda. ""As part of their deception, we allege that Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman-Fried schemed to manipulate the price of FTT, an exchange crypto security token that was integral to FTX, to prop up the value of their house of cards,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""We further allege that Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang played an active role in a scheme to misuse FTX customer assets to prop up Alameda and to post collateral for margin trading.

958,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and Zixiao (Gary) Wang, the former Chief Technology Officer of FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX), for their roles in a multiyear scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX, the crypto trading platform co-founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried and Wang. Investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing. According to the SEC?s complaint, between 2019 and 2022, Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, furthered the scheme by manipulating the price of FTT, an FTX-issued exchange crypto security token, by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up its price. FTT served as collateral for undisclosed loans by FTX of its customers? assets to Alameda, a crypto hedge fund owned by Wang and Bankman-Fried and run by Ellison. The complaint alleges that, by manipulating the price of FTT, Bankman-Fried and Ellison caused the valuation of Alameda?s FTT holdings to be inflated, which in turn caused the value of collateral on Alameda?s balance sheet to be overstated, and misled investors about FTX?s risk exposure. In addition, the complaint alleges that, from at least May 2019 until November 2022, Bankman-Fried raised billions of dollars from investors by falsely touting FTX as a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and by telling investors that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges; meanwhile, Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted FTX customer assets to Alameda. The complaint alleges that Ellison and Wang knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading.? The complaint also alleges that Ellison and Wang were active participants in the scheme to deceive FTX?s investors and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success. The complaint alleges that Wang created FTX?s software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds, and Ellison used misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda?s trading activity. The complaint further alleges that, even as it became clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried, with the knowledge of Ellison and Wang, directed hundreds of millions of dollars more in FTX customer funds to Alameda. ""As part of their deception, we allege that Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman-Fried schemed to manipulate the price of FTT, an exchange crypto security token that was integral to FTX, to prop up the value of their house of cards,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""We further allege that Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang played an active role in a scheme to misuse FTX customer assets to prop up Alameda and to post collateral for margin trading. When FTT and the rest of the house of cards collapsed, Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison, and Mr. Wang left investors holding the bag. Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist. It remains a priority of the SEC to use all of our available tools to bring the industry into compliance.""
